    "As an alternative method to sample the joint mRNA protein distribution $P(m, p)$ we can use the Gillespie algorithm. This is a great alternative since the algorithm is widely used in many fields and therefore its intuitive implementation is familiar to a broad audience. Having said that, as we will show in this notebook, the algorithm can be computationally inefficient for large sample spaces since the number of computations that one has to generate to reliably sample the distribution usually grows as $N^2$ where $N$ is the sample space size."

These propensities dictate how likely it is for each of the possible reactions to take place. Some of the propensities have a fix value and others are updated as the chemical species change their numbers. For example, the propensity of producing an mRNA can be considered fix for a single promoter since it is just given by the mRNA production rate $r_m$, while the propensity for an mRNA to be degraded changes as the number of mRNA changes since it is given by the product of the mRNA degradation rate $\\gm$ times the number of mRNAs $m$.\n",
