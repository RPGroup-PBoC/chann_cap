# `Python` scripts

This directory contains `pythons` scripts derived from the computations in the
`theory` notebooks. While in the notebooks we explain the logic and coding of
all the computations, in here we store scripts that use such computations
heavily. For example, when computing certain quantities for a myriad of
parameter values, instead of having the code in the notebook, we limit perform
such computations here. These scripts are grouped by the notebook from which
they derive.
