Our theoretical model predicts the protein distribution $P(p)$, but in reality what we get to observe is not this quantity, but an indirect redout given by a number of electrons that the photomultiplier in the microscope camera emits given a certain number of photons. That means we have a Markov chain of the form\n",

More fundamentally we see that the single-cell intensity data that we obtain from microscopy has a higher noise compared with the theoretical predictions. Here we will try to model sources of experimental noise to see if we can explain the discrepancy between theory and data. Our first attempt will be to model a Poisson distributed amount of photons from each fluorophore."
