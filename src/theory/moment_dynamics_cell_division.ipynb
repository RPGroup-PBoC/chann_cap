    "As first discussed by Jones et al. and then further expanded by [Peterson et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/15886) the effect of having multiple gene copy numbers due to genome replication during the cell cycle has an important effect on gene expression noise. As the genome is replicated the cells spend part of their cell cycle with > 1 copy of the gene. The number of copies depends on the growth rate and on the gene position relative to the genome replication origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our experimental setup we know from Jones et al. that our cells spend 2/3 of the cell cycle with 2 copies of the reporter gene and 1/3 with one copy. We previously inferred the parameters $\\kpon$, $\\kpoff$, and $r_m$ assuming that at both stages the mRNA reached steady state with $r_m$ as production rate for 1 gene copy and $2 r_m$ for two copies. The objective of this notebook is to explore the dynamical consequences of these gene copy number variations at the level of the mRNA and protein distribution moments."

    "The first thing we need to establish are the dynamics for the mRNA. The cell doubling time $t_d \\approx 60$ min establishes the period of the cell cycle. For a time $0 < t_s < t_d$ cells have 1 copy of the gene (i.e. mRNA production rate $r_m$) and for the rest of the cycle the cells have 2 copies of the gene (i.e. mRNA production rate of $2 r_m$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore for our simulations we will initialize the moments at the steady state values for the single promoter, run the simulation with those parameters for time 0 to $t_s$ and then change the parameters for the rest of the simulation until reaching time $t_d$."

    "After cells reach time $t_d$ the content of the cells is assumed to divide as the cells split into two daughter cells. To account for this division we will assume that the mean mRNA (and later on protein) count are halved. Given the dependence of higher moments on the first moment we will \"re-initialize\" the value of the other moments assuming the values that one would obtain if this halved mean mRNA count was the steady state value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words assume that the mean mRNA count at time $t_d$ is given by $\\ee{m(t_d)}$. After this time we reset the initial condition for the simulation with one promoter to be $\\ee{m(t=0)} = {\\ee{m(t_d)} \\over 2}$. By fixing the first moment values higher moments of the mRNA distirbution $\\ee{m^x}$ will be computed by finding what the steady state value would be given the value of the first moment. Note that this will not strictly give the same values as just computing the steady state value of the moments. If the initial condition $\\ee{m(t=0)}$ is not the same as steady state condition $\\ee{m}_{ss}$ the values that the other moments will also differ from the steady state values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this convoluted assumption is that dividing the first moment in half after cell division makes sense, but it is not clear that the same assumption applies for higher moments of the distribution. To gain intuition about this assume that the mRNA distribution is binomial with mean value $\\ee{m(t_d)} = N p$. Dividing this by half for the initial condition is easy since we would have $\\ee{m(t=0)} = {N p \\over 2}$. The second moment before the cell division would be of the form $\\ee{m^2(t_d)} = Np - Np^2 + N^2p^2$. Therefore dividing this value by two for the initial condition of the next cell cycle doesn't translate to the second moment one would expect for a binomial distribution with mean ${Np \\over 2}$."
