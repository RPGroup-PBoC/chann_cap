## Description
#Testing the idea that cells could have memory of their time
#in LB. Therefore cells for this experiment were grown at all
#stages in M9 + 0.5% glucose. Overnights were done on this 
#media as well as the experiment obviously.

### Microscope settings
#
#* 100x Oil objective
#* Exposure time:
#1. Brightfield : 50 ms
#2. mCherry : 75 ms
#3. YFP : 70 ms (1 Volt power)
#
### Experimental protocol
#
#The strains were grown overnight in tubes in 2 mL of M9 glucose + spec + kan.
#These tubes grew for > 16 hours since they were inoculated the day before 
#early in the morning.
#Next morning I diluted the strains 1:1000 into 3 mL of 
#fresh media.
#I then prepared a 2% agar pad with PBS buffer and image them with the
#usual imaging settings
#
### Notes & Observations
#These cells grew extended time in M9 to guarantee that they reached the
#expected steady state.
#I forgot to take the camera noise so I copied the one from 20190626.
