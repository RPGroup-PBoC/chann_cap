#Description : 
#IPTG titration of the O3 - RBS1027 strain.
#Strains :
#> HG105 galK::25 / pZS3-mCherry (auto)
#> HG105 galK::25-O3+11-YFP / pZS3-mCherry (delta)
#> HG105 galK::25-O3+11-YFP; ybcN::4*RBS1027-lacI / pZS3-mCherry
#
#The strains were grown overnight in tubes in 3 mL of LB + spec + kan. 
#Next morning they were diluted 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose 
#also in deep 96-well plates.
#The auto and delta strains were grown without IPTG
#The analysis strain was grown with the following IPTG concentrations
#IPTG concentrations:
#0uM, 0.1uM, 1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM
#After 8 hours the cells were diluted 1:10 into M9 + glucose and imaged
#using 2% agar pads also of M9 media.
#
#Microscope settings:
#100x Oil objective
#Exposure time:
#> Brightfield : 25 ms
#> mCherry : 15 ms
#> YFP : 10 ms
#
#Comments :
# 1) I am sure I overexpose the images. It wasn't a big fraction of the pixels,
# so I decided to carry on with the experiment.
# 2) I forgot to take the noise profile from the camera. So for the analysis
# I used the noise profile from 20161203
