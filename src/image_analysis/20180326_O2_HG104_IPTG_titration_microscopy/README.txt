#Description : 
#IPTG titration of the O2 - HG104 strain.
#Strains :
#> HG105 galK::25 / pZS3-mCherry (auto)
#> HG105 galK::25-O2+11-YFP / pZS4-mCherry (delta)
#> HG104 galK::25-O2+11-YFP / pZS4-mCherry
#
#The strains were grown overnight in tubes in 3 mL of LB + spec + kan. 
#Next morning they were diluted 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose 
#also in deep 96-well plates.
#The auto and delta strains were grown without IPTG
#The analysis strain was grown with the following IPTG concentrations
#IPTG concentrations:
#0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
#After 8 hours the cells were diluted 1:10 into M9 + glucose and imaged
#using 2% agar pads also of M9 media.
#
#Microscope settings:
#100x Oil objective
#Exposure time:
#> Brightfield : 3 ms
#> mCherry : 18 ms
#> YFP : 9 ms
#
#Comments :
# It is possible that the media is not the right one. I had to do a much
# smaller dilution (1:3) to get the right number of cells and for a
# different project my labmates have found that my media seems to make
# cells grow slower.
