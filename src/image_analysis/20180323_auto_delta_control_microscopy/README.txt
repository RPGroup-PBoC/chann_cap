#Description : 
#IPTG titration of the O2 - HG104 strain.
#Strains :
#> HG105 galK::25 / pZS3-mCherry (auto)
#> HG105 galK::25-O2+11-YFP / pZS4-mCherry (delta)
#
#The strains were grown overnight in tubes in 3 mL of LB + spec + kan. 
#Next morning they were diluted 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose 
#also in deep 96-well plates.
#The analysis strain was grown with the following IPTG concentrations
#IPTG concentrations:
#0uM, 5uM, 25uM, 75uM,250uM,1000uM
#After 8 hours the cells were diluted 1:10 into M9 + glucose and imaged
#using 2% agar pads also of M9 media.
#
#Microscope settings:
#100x Oil objective
#Exposure time:
#> Brightfield : 5 ms
#> mCherry : 18 ms
#> YFP : 10 ms
#
#Comments :
# For the auto 1000uM there seem to be some strains that were very low 
# in mCherry fluorescence. It could be that it was contamination
