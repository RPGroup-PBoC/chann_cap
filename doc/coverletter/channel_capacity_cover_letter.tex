Dear editors,

It is our great pleasure to submit for your consideration for publication in
Nature Physics our paper entitled ``First-principles prediction of the
information processing capacity of a simple genetic circuit.'' One of the
defining features of living organisms is their ability to acquire information
from the environment, allowing them to respond accordingly in order to maximize
their chances of surviving. With a growing interest on what are the limits of
this ability to gather information, the community has come to realize that
evolution has pushed many times living organisms to perform at the limits of
what physics allows. However an ongoing question in the field is how - given
noisy signals and signal transduction systems operating at the molecular scale -
can organism achieve such precision in their measurements. The question is a
formidable challenge to tackle given the complexity of biological signaling
systems. In this work, we make progress towards understanding the interplay
between biophysical parameters such as protein copy numbers and the affinity of
interactions between molecular components to allow cells to gather information
from the environment.

To tackle this question we approach the problem from a theory-experiment
dialogue point of view. The advent of technological developments such as
quantitative microscopy has allowed the physics community to approach biological
systems as a rich playground in which to explore how out of equilibrium systems
operate. In particular the question of how cells control the expression of their
genes has attracted a lot of attention given the relevance of this question in
biology, and the clear role that physical thinking can have on shedding light on
this problem. My group over the last decade has worked hard in developing a
simple toy model of a genetic circuit that is tracktable both theoretically and
experimentally. This simple circuit that we consider to be the ``hydrogen atom''
of genetic regulation has served as a productive sandbox in which to test
physical models of how cells decide to turn on and off their genes.

For this paper we compile all the experimental data accumulated over the years
in order to inform all the parameters of our simple kinetic model based on what
is known about the physics of how the gene regulatory machinery works. The model
describes how, as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell,
the affinity of these proteins for a specific binding site in the DNA, and the
extracellular concentration of a signaling molecule, cells respond by expressing
a protein. With no free parameters we show how our model is able to capture the
cell-to-cell variability in this response for different combinations of
parameters. We then contextualize these input-output functions into what could
cells harboring this signaling system do by computing the channel capacity, i.e.
the maximum amount of information that cells could process with this system. In
this context the information that cells could process refers to the resolution
with which cells can distinguish different environmental states, i.e.
signaling molecule concentrations. Again our model is able to capture
experimental inferences of this information processing capacity, demonstrating
that our simple zero-parameter fit model is able to predict the amount of bits
that cells can gather from the environment.

For this first pass we wanted to be complete and thorough for you and the
potential reviewers to fully understand the meaning of our findings. We have a
clear strategy on how to summarize the findings in order for them to fit within
the Nature Physics guidelines.

Though you surely have an outstanding list of reviewers to appeal to, we suggest
other excellent candidates:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Jeremy Gunawardena (Harvard University) - We consider Gunawardena to be
	one of the deepest thinkers when it comes to the role of theory in biology.
	His constant innovative thinking has kept him at the forefront of the
	interface between physics and biology.
	\item Peter Swain (University of Edinburgh) - Swain is a dean of the field of
	information processing in living organisms. Over the years he has shown how
	clear physical thinking can sharpen the types of hypothesis that can be tested
	in the context of how cells make decisions.
	\item William Bialek (Princeton University) - Bialek's work has greatly
	inspired our efforts present here. For several years he has explored the
	physical limits of the performance that biological organisms harboring simple
	molecular signal-transduction systems can have.
	\item Andre Levchenko (Yale university) - Levchenko has shown in the past the
	application of information theory to biological signal transduction systems.
	Part of his analysis pipeline was adapted here to extract useful information
	from our experimental data.
	\item Ilya Nemenman (Emory University) -  Nemenman's previous work on
	information encoding in the brain and the application of information theoretic
	ideas to biological systems puts him in an ideal position to contextualize the
	work presented here.
\end{itemize}

We also request that Prof. Terrence Hwa and Prof. Jose Vilar be excluded as
possible reviewers. Though we deeply admire their work, we think they tend to be
unduly harsh when it comes to a peer-review process.

To ensure transparency with every piece of information presented in this paper,
we have made all image data publicly available on the CaltechDATA repository
and can be accessed via the DOI:XXX. All code used in the processing, analysis,
and figure generation for this work is also publicly available on this paper's
GitHub repository accessible at \url{https://github.com/mrazomej/chann_cap}.
We have complemented this information with a website solely designed for this
paper \url{https://mrazomej.github.io/chann_cap/} where the data and analysis
files are more easily accessible for the general public.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing your decision.
