\subsection{Computing the moments of the mRNA and protein distributions}
\label{sec_moments}

Solving chemical master equations represent a challenge that is still an active
area of research \cite{Dinh2016}. An alternative approach is to find schemes to
approximate the distribution. One such scheme, the maximum entropy approach,
makes use of the moments of the distribution to approximate the full
distribution. In this section we will demonstrate an iterative algorithm to
compute the mRNA and protein distribution moments.

Our simple repression kinetic model depicted in \fref{fig2_minimal_model}(A)
consists of an infinite system of ODEs for each possible pair $m, p$. To
compute any moment of our chemical master equation we define a vector
\begin{equation}
	\ee{\bb{m^x p^y}} \equiv (\ee{m^x p^y}_B, \ee{m^x p^y}_E, \ee{m^x p^y}_R)^T,
\end{equation}
where $\ee{m^x p^y}_S$ is the expected value of $m^x p^y$ in state $S \in \{B,
E, R\}$ for $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, just as we defined the vector
$\PP(m, p)$, here we define a vector to collect the expected value of each of
the promoter states. By definition any of these moments $\ee{m^x p^y}_S$ are
computed as
\begin{equation}
  \ee{m^x p^y}_S \equiv \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{p=0}^\infty m^x p^y P_S(m, p).
  \label{eq_mom_def}
\end{equation}

Summing over all possible $m$ and $p$ values in \eref{eq_cme_matrix} results in
a ODE for any moment of the distribution of the form (See \siref{supp_moments}
for full derivation)
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \dt{\bb{\ee{m^x p^y}}} &=
    \Km \bb{\ee{m^x p^y}}\\
    &+ \Rm \bb{\ee{p^y \left[ (m + 1)^x -m^x \right]}}\\
    &+ \Gm \bb{\ee{m p^y \left[ (m - 1)^x - m^x \right]}}\\
    &+ \Rp \bb{\ee{m^{(x + 1)} \left[ (p + 1)^y - p^y \right]}}\\
    &+ \Gp \bb{\ee{m^x p \left[ (p - 1)^y - p^y \right]}}.
    \label{eq_gral_mom}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Given that all transitions in our stochastic model are first order reactions,
\eref{eq_gral_mom} has no moment-closure problem \cite{Voliotis2014a}. What this
means is that the dynamical equation for a given moment only depends on lower
moments (See \siref{supp_moments} for full proof). This feature of our model
implies, for example, that the second moment of the protein distribution
$\ee{p^2}$ depends only on the first two moments of the mRNA distribution
$\ee{m}$, and $\ee{m^2}$, the first protein moment $\ee{p}$  and the
cross-correlation term $\ee{mp}$. We can therefore define $\bmu$ to be a
vector containing all moments up to $\bb{\ee{m^x p^y}}$ for all promoter states.
This is
\begin{equation}
\bmu = \left[ \bb{\ee{m^0 p^0}},
							\bb{\ee{m^1 p^0}},
							\ldots, \bb{\ee{m^x p^y}} \right]^T.
\end{equation}
Explicitly for the three-state promoter model depicted in
\fref{fig2_minimal_model}(A) this vector takes the form
\begin{equation}
	\bmu = \left[ \ee{m^0 p^0}_B, \ee{m^0 p^0}_E, \ee{m^0 p^0}_R,
	\ldots, \ee{m^x p^y}_B, \ee{m^x p^y}_E, \ee{m^x p^y}_R \right]^T.
\end{equation}

Given this definition we can compute the general moment dynamics as
\begin{equation}
\dt{\bmu} = \bb{A} \bmu,
\label{eq_mom_dynamics}
\end{equation}
where $\bb{A}$ is a square matrix that contains all the numeric coefficients
that relate each of the moments. We can then use \eref{eq_gral_mom} to build
matrix $\bb{A}$ by iteratively substituting values for the exponents $x$ and $y$
up to a specified value. In the next section, we will use \eref{eq_mom_dynamics}
to numerically integrate the dynamical equations for our moments of interest as
cells progress through the cell cycle.
