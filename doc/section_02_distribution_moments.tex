\section{Computing the distribution moments}

Solving chemical master equations represent a challenge that is still an active
area of mathematical research \cite{Dinh2016}. Methods to approximate the
distribution vary in mathematical and computational sophistication. One of such
methods, the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach makes use of the distribution
moments to approximate the full distribution. In this section we will
demonstrate an iterative algorithm to compute the mRNA and protein joint
distribution moments.

\mrm{Note that in the previous section I will have already written the master
equation in matrix notation.}
Our simple repression kinetic model depicted in \fref{fig2_minimal_model}(A)
consists on a infinite system of ODEs for each possible pair $m, p$. To
compute any moment of our chemical master equation let us define a vector
\begin{equation}
	\ee{\bb{m^x p^y}} \equiv (\ee{m^x p^y}_E, \ee{m^x p^y}_P, \ee{m^x p^y}_R)^T,
\end{equation}
where $\ee{m^x p^y}_S$ is the expected value of $m^x p^y$ in state $S \in \{E,
P, R\}$ for $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, just as we defined the vector
$\PP(m, p)$, here we define a vector to collect the expected value of each of
the promoter states. By definition any of these moments $\ee{m^x p^y}_S$ are
computed as
\begin{equation}
  \ee{m^x p^y}_S \equiv \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{p=0}^\infty m^x p^y P_S(m, p).
  \label{eq_mom_def}
\end{equation}

Summing over all possible $m$ and $p$ values on \mrm{ref chem eq in matrix
notation} and further simplifying results in a single ODE for all moments of the
form
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \dt{\bb{\ee{m^x p^y}}} &=
    \Km \bb{\ee{m^x p^y}}\\
    &+ \Rm \bb{\ee{p^y \left[ (m + 1)^x -m^x \right]}}\\
    &+ \Gm \bb{\ee{m p^y \left[ (m - 1)^x - m^x \right]}}\\
    &+ \Rp \bb{\ee{m^{(x + 1)} \left[ (p + 1)^y - p^y \right]}}\\
    &+ \Gp \bb{\ee{m^x p \left[ (p - 1)^y - p^y \right]}}.
    \label{eq_gral_mom}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\mrm{See appendix XX for details on simplification.}

Given that all transitions in our stochastic model are first order reactions,
\eref{eq_gral_mom} has no moment-closure problem. What this means is that
moments only depend on lower moments \mrm{See appendix XX for full proof}. This
feature of our model implies for example that the second moment of the protein
distribution $\ee{p^2}$ depends only on the first two moments of the mRNA
distribution $\ee{m}$, and $\ee{m^2}$, the first protein moment $\ee{p}$  and
the cross-correlation term $\ee{mp}$. We can therefore define $\bb{\mu}$ to be a
vector containing all moments up to $\bb{\ee{m^x p^y}}$ for all promoter states.
This is
\begin{equation}
\bb{\mu} = \left[ \bb{\ee{m^0 p^0}},
								  \bb{\ee{m^1 p^0}},
									\ldots \bb{\ee{m^x p^y}} \right]^T.
\end{equation}
Explicitly for the three-state promoter this vector looks like
\begin{equation}
	\bb{\mu} = \left[ \ee{m^0 p^0}_E, \ee{m^0 p^0}_P, \ee{m^0 p^0}_R, \ldots
                 \ee{m^x p^y}_E, \ee{m^x p^y}_P, \ee{m^x p^y}_R \right]^T.
\end{equation}

Given this definition we can define the general moment dynamics as
\begin{equation}
\dt{\mu} = \bb{A \mu},
\label{eq_mom_dynamics}
\end{equation}
where $\bb{A}$ is a square matrix that contains all the connections in the
network, i.e. the numeric coefficients that relate each of the moments. In the
next section we will use \eref{eq_mom_dynamics} to numerically integrate the
distribution moments as cells progress through the cell cycle.
