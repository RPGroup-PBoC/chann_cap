\talComment{Potential other figures:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Varying cross all $R$ and $k_{off}$ values, what is the maximal channel capacity you can achieve?
		\item Potentially look at Mitch Lewis's strains which will have different $K_{DNA}$ or $K_{A}$ and $K_{I}$ parameters and redo the analysis there, showing that the theory is amazingly good!
