abstract = {Molecular noise restricts the ability of an individual cell to resolve input signals of different strengths and gather information about the external environment. Transmitting information through complex signaling networks with redundancies can overcome this limitation. We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise. Bottlenecks likewise constrain information attained by networks signaling through multiple genes or cells.},
annote = {In this paper Levchenko et al theoretically and experimentally characterize the information transmission of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway.
They go and explore two different network architectures (bush without a bottleneck and tree with a bottleneck node) and study how cells can overcome information transmission restrictions due to noise.

This paper is relevant to the project since the authors experimentally characterize the channel capacity of the network, setting up a potential methodology for my own experiments.},

abstract = {In 1961, Jacob and Monod proposed the operon model for gene regulation based on metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli. This proposal was followed by an explication of allosteric behavior by Monod and colleagues. The operon model rationally depicted how genetic mechanisms can control metabolic events in response to environmental stimuli via coordinated transcription of a set of genes with related function (e.g. metabolism of lactose). The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms. These two models have shaped our view of modern molecular biology and captivated the attention of a surprisingly broad range of scientists. More recently, the lactose repressor monomer was used as a model system for experimental and theoretical explorations of protein folding mechanisms. Thus, the lac system continues to advance our molecular understanding of genetic control and the relationship between sequence, structure and function.},

abstract = {Allostery, the modulation of function of a protein at one site by the binding of a ligand at a different site, is a property of many proteins. Two kinetically distinct models have been proposed: i) The induced fit model in which the ligand binds to the protein and then induces the conformational change. ii) The population selection model, in which the protein spontaneously undergoes a conformational change, which is then 'captured' by the ligand. Using measured kinetic constants for the lac repressor the contribution of population selection vs. induced dissociation is quantified by simulating the kinetics of allostery. At very low inducer concentration, both mechanisms contribute significantly. Total induction, though, is small under these conditions. At increasing levels of induction the induced dissociation mechanism soon dominates, first due to binding of one inducer, and then from two inducers binding. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Largely because of advances in the techniques of molecular biology in the past few decades, our knowledge of regulation by most of these mechanisms has expanded enormously. Regulation by small-molecule, allosteric interactions is an exception. Many of the best-known allosteric regulators were discovered decades ago, when we knew little about all of these other forms of regulation. Allostery is the most direct, rapid, and efficient regulatory mechanism to sense changes in the concentration of small molecules and alter cellular responses to maintain homeostasis. In this perspective, we present the argument that allosteric regulation is underappreciated in the systems biology world and that many allosteric effectors remain to be discovered.},

abstract = {Lactose repressor (LacI) is one of the best studied prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins till date. Detailed structural, biochemical and genetic studies are being carried out on LacI since four decades to understand its ligand binding properties and the basis of allosteric response. We applied directed evolution methods on LacI to generate mutants with altered allosteric properties. After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier. The mutant Lac repressors seem to operate as very good molecular switches by inducing gene expression at 1 microM of IPTG and confer 2-10 times higher level of gene expression as compared with the WT (wild -type).},

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },

abstract = {Models of transcription are often built around a picture of RNA polymerase and transcription factors (TFs) acting on a single copy of a promoter. However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number - in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an essential component of all metabolic pathways. At the most basic level, a protein binds to a particular DNA sequence (operator) on the genome and either positively or negatively alters the level of transcription. Together, the protein and its operator form an epigenetic switch that regulates gene expression. In an effort to produce a 'better' switch, we have discovered novel facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We have uncovered a relationship between operator binding affinity and inducibility and demonstrated that the operator DNA is not a passive component of a genetic switch; it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity as well as translational efficiency. In addition, an operator's directionality can indirectly affect gene expression. Unraveling the basic properties of this classical epigenetic switch demonstrates that multiple factors must be optimized in designing a better switch.},

@article{MONOD1965,
abstract = {We report that during cortical development in the mouse embryo, reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) critically regulates Notch signaling by antagonizing the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands, which is mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10). In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},

A comparison of the two techniques reveals that filter-binding assays with tetrameric Lac repressor have often been misinterpreted. It has been assumed that all complexes of Lac repressor and lac operator DNA bind with equal affinity to nitrocellulose filters. This assumption is wrong. Sandwich or loop complexes where two lac operators bind to one tetrameric Lac repressor are not or are only badly retained on nitrocellulose filters under normal conditions. Taking this into account, dimeric and tetrameric Lac repressor do not show any DNA-length dependence of their association and dissociation rate constants when they bind to DNA fragments smaller than 2455 base-pairs carrying a single symmetric ideal lac operator. A ninefold increased association rate to ideal lac operator on ?? DNA is observed for tetrameric but not dimeric Lac repressor.

abstract = {The ability to regulate gene expression is of central importance for the adaptability of living organisms to changes in their external and internal environment. At the transcriptional level, binding of transcription factors (TFs) in the promoter region can modulate the transcription rate, hence making TFs central players in gene regulation. For some model organisms, information about the locations and identities of discovered TF binding sites have been collected in continually updated databases, such as RegulonDB for the well-studied case of E. coli. In order to reveal the general principles behind the binding-site arrangement and function of these regulatory architectures we propose a random promoter architecture model that preserves the overall abundance of binding sites to identify overrepresented binding site configurations. This model is analogous to the random network model used in the study of genetic network motifs, where regulatory motifs are identified through their overrepresentation with respect to a "randomly connected" genetic network. Using our model we identify TF pairs which coregulate operons in an overrepresented fashion, or individual TFs which act at multiple binding sites per promoter by, for example, cooperative binding, DNA looping, or through multiple binding domains. We furthermore explore the relationship between promoter architecture and gene expression, using three different genome-wide protein copy number censuses. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no systematic correlation between the number of activator and repressor binding sites regulating a gene and the level of gene expression. A position-weight-matrix model used to estimate the binding affinity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the promoters of activated and repressed genes suggests that this lack of correlation might in part be due to differences in basal transcription levels, with repressed genes having a higher basal activity level. This quantitative catalogue relating promoter architecture and function provides a first step towards genome-wide predictive models of regulatory function.},

We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators. A short distance of 92 bp allows effective repression by two very weak operators (O3, O3). The cooperativity of lac operators is discussed in terms of a local increase of repressor concentration. This increase in concentration depends on flexible DNA which allows loop formation.},

This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

Direct measurement, using Pt-C shadow width standards, was 9.6 +/- 0.2 nm long. Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein has been modified with three sulfhydryl-specific reagents which form mixed disulfide adducts. Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) completely reacted with all three cysteine residues, whereas only partial reaction was observed with didansylcystine. Cysteines-107 and -140 reacted stoichiometrically with MMTS and DTNB, while Cys-281 was modified only at higher molar ratios. Didansylcystine reacted primarily with cysteines-107 and -140. Affinity of MMTS-modified repressor for 40 base pair operator DNA was decreased 30-fold compared to unmodified repressor, and this decrease correlated with modification of cysteine-281. DTNB-modified repressor bound operator DNA with a 50-fold weaker affinity than unmodified repressor. Modification of the lac repressor with didanylcystine decreased operator binding only 4-fold, and nonspecific DNA binding increased 3-fold compared to unmodified repressor. No change in the inducer equilibrium binding constant was observed following modification with any of these reagents. In contrast, inducer association and dissociation rate constants were decreased approximately 50-fold for repressor completely modified with MMTS or DTNB, while didansylcystine had minimal effect on inducer binding kinetics. Correlation between modification of Cys-281 and the observed decrease in rate constants indicates that this region of the protein regulates the accessibility of the sugar binding site. The parallel between the increase in the Kd for repressor binding to operator, the altered rate constant for inducer binding, and modification of cysteine-281 suggests that this region of the protein is crucially involved in the function of the repressor protein.},

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {The rates of binding of inducer molecules to the lactose repressor protein are significantly affected by the presence of bound operator DNA fragments. The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

The three-dimensional structures of the intact lac repressor, the lac repressor bound to the gratuitous inducer isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and the lac repressor complexed with a 21-base pair symmetric operator DNA have been determined. These three structures show the conformation of the molecule in both the induced and repressed states and provide a framework for understanding a wealth of biochemical and genetic information. The DNA sequence of the lac operon has three lac repressor recognition sites in a stretch of 500 base pairs. The crystallographic structure of the complex with DNA suggests that the tetrameric repressor functions synergistically with catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) and participates in the quaternary formation of repression loops in which one tetrameric repressor interacts simultaneously with two sites on the genomic DNA.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {To expand our understanding of the hallmarks of allosteric control we used directed-evolution to engineer alternate cooperative communication in the lactose repressor protein (LacI) scaffold. Starting with an I(s) type LacI mutant D88A (i.e. a LacI variant that is insensitive to the exogenous ligand isopropyl-$\beta$-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and remains bound to operator DNA, + or -IPTG) we used error-prone polymerase chain reaction to introduce compensatory mutations to restore modulated DNA binding function to the allosterically 'dead' I(s)D88A background. Five variants were generated, three variants (C4, C32 and C80) with wild-type like function and two co-repressor variants (C101 and C140) that are functionally inverted. To better resolve the residues that define new allosteric networks in the LacI variants, we conducted mutational tolerance analysis via saturation mutagenesis at each of the evolved positions to assess sensitivity to mutation-a hallmark of allosteric residues. To better understand the physicochemical bases of alternate allosteric function, variant LacIC80 was characterized to assess IPTG ligand binding at equilibrium, kinetically using stopped-flow, and via isothermal titration calorimetry. These data suggest that the conferred modulated DNA binding function observed for LacIC80, while thermodynamically similar to wild-type LacI, is mechanistically different from the wild-type repressor, suggesting a new allosteric network and communication route.},

abstract = {The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60{\%} of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur.},

abstract = {We present here the results of a series of small-angle X-ray scattering studies aimed at understanding the role of conformational changes and structural flexibility in DNA binding and allosteric signaling in a bacterial transcription regulator, lactose repressor protein (LacI). Experiments were designed to detect possible conformational changes that occur when LacI binds either DNA or the inducer IPTG, or both. Our studies included the native LacI dimer of homodimers and a dimeric variant (R3), enabling us to probe conformational changes within the homodimers and distinguish them from those involving changes in the homodimer-homodimer relationships. The scattering data indicate that removal of operator DNA (oDNA) from R3 results in an unfolding and extension of the hinge helix that connects the LacI regulatory and DNA-binding domains. In contrast, only very subtle conformational changes occur in the R3 dimer-oDNA complex upon IPTG binding, indicative of small adjustments in the orientations of domains and/or subdomains within the structure. The binding of IPTG to native (tetrameric) LacI-oDNA complexes also appears to facilitate a modest change in the average homodimer-homodimer disposition. Notably, the crystal structure of the native LacI-oDNA complex differs significantly from the average solution conformation. The solution scattering data are best fit by an ensemble of structures that includes (1) ??? 60{\%} of the V-shaped dimer of homodimers observed in the crystal structure and (2) ??? 40{\%} of molecules with more "open" forms, such as those generated when the homodimers move with respect to each other about the tetramerization domain. In gene regulation, such a flexible LacI would be beneficial for the interaction of its two DNA-binding domains, positioned at the tips of the V, with the required two of three LacI operators needed for full repression. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Two-component systems, which are comprised of a single histidine-aspartate phosphotransfer module, are the dominant signaling pathways in bacteria and have recently been identified in several eukaryotic organisms as well. A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3−-activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3− activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

Among these techniques, NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here, we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions.

abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein (LacI) was among the very first genetic regulatory proteins discovered, and more than 1000 members of the bacterial LacI/GalR family are now identified. LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response. Thus, this family exhibits a symphony of variations by which transcriptional control is achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The proteins associated with gene regulation are often shared between multiple pathways simultaneously. By way of contrast, models in regulatory biology often assume these pathways act independently. We demonstrate a framework for calculating the change in gene expression for the interacting case by decoupling repressor occupancy across the cell from the gene of interest by way of a chemical potential. The details of the interacting regulatory architecture are encompassed in an effective concentration, and thus, a single scaling function describes a collection of gene expression data from diverse regulatory situations and collapses it onto a single master curve.},

abstract = {Large scale models of physical phenomena demand the development of new statistical and computational tools in order to be effective. Many such models are "sloppy," i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher information matrix, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

The lac operon is a paradigm for understanding how metabolites function as signaling molecules and modulate transcription. These metabolites or allosteric effector molecules bind to the repressor and alter the conformational equilibrium between the induced and the repressed states. Here, we describe a set of experiments where we modified a single inducer binding site in a dimeric repressor and examined its effect on induction. Based upon these observations, we have been able to calculate the thermodynamic parameters that are responsible for the allosteric properties that govern repressor function.

abstract = {Binding of the Lac repressor to its operator DNA controls the expression of the genes of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Lac repressor's affinity for the lac operator is diminished by an inducer that affects the structure of the repressor tetramer. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant Lac repressor i-t gene, whose product, the LacR-t repressor, shows a higher affinity for the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and a lower affinity for the lac operator than the wild-type repressor. We show that the altered phenotype is due to a single amino acid residue replacement; the alanine residue at position 110 in the wild-type is replaced by threonine in i-t. Other amino acid residues in position 110 have been shown to result in an i-s phenotype. For the i-s-substitution of alanine 110 with lysine we demonstrate an increase in the affinity for operator DNA and a decrease in the affinity for IPTG. Thus, A110--{\textgreater} K shows the opposite effect to A110--{\textgreater}T on the repressor protein. We explain the phenotype of the LacR mutants by displacements of the conformational equilibrium for the dimeric repressor unit between RR (high operator affinity, low inducer affinity) and R*R* (low operator affinity, high inducer affinity) towards R*R* in the i-t and towards RR in the i-s mutant in position 110 with respect to the wild-type. The putative structures of the wild-type and mutant Lac repressors confirm this conclusion.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

This framework can facilitate the quantification of vastly different forms of gene expression from several well-characterized bacterial promoters that are regulated by one or two species of transcription factors; it is useful because it requires only a few parameters. As such, it provides a compact description useful for higher-level studies (e.g. of genetic networks) without the need to invoke the biochemical details of every component.

Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {Chloride is the allosteric effector of vertebrate pancreatic and salivary [alpha]-amylases and of the bacterial [alpha]-amylase from Alteromonas haloplanctis. Activation experiments of A. haloplanctis [alpha]-amylase by several monovalent anions show that a negative charge, not restricted to that of Cl[-], is essential for the amylolytic reaction. Engineering of the chloride binding site reveals that a basic residue is an essential component of the site. The mutation K337R alters the Cl[-]-binding properties, whereas the mutation K337Q produces an active, chloride-independent enzyme. Comparison of the Kd values for Cl[-] in three homologous [alpha]-amylases also indicates that the binding affinity is dependent on the chloride coordination mode by this basic residue. Analysis of substrate and chloride binding according to the allosteric kinetic model shows that the chloride effector is not involved in substrate binding. By contrast, the pH dependence of activity and experiments of chemical modifications and Ca2+ inhibition show that the chloride ion is responsible for the pKa shift of catalytic groups and interacts with active site carboxyl groups.},

abstract = {Analysis of proteins commonly requires the partition of their structure into regions such as the surface, interior, or interface. Despite the frequent use of such categorization, no consensus definition seems to exist. This study thus aims at providing a definition that is general, is simple to implement, and yields new biological insights. This analysis relies on 397, 196, and 701 protein structures from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, respectively, and the conclusions are consistent across all three species. A threshold of 25{\%} relative accessible surface area best segregates amino acids at the interior and at the surface. This value is further used to extend the core-rim model of protein-protein interfaces and to introduce a third region called support. Interface core, rim, and support regions contain similar numbers of residues on average, but core residues contribute over two-thirds of the contact surface. The amino acid composition of each region remains similar across different organisms and interface types. The interface core composition is intermediate between the surface and the interior, but the compositions of the support and the rim are virtually identical with those of the interior and the surface, respectively. The support and rim could thus "preexist" in proteins, and evolving a new interaction could require mutations to form an interface core only. Using the interface regions defined, it is shown through simulations that only two substitutions are necessary to shift the average composition of a 1000-{\AA}(2) surface patch involving ∼28 residues to that of an equivalent interface. This analysis and conclusions will help understand the notion of promiscuity in protein-protein interaction networks.},

abstract = {The 50th anniversary of the classic Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model provides an opportunity to survey the broader conceptual and quantitative implications of this quintessential biophysical model. With the use of statistical mechanics, the mathematical implementation of the MWC concept links problems that seem otherwise to have no ostensible biological connection including ligand-receptor binding, ligand-gated ion channels, chemotaxis, chromatin structure and gene regulation. Hence, a thorough mathematical analysis of the MWC model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke. The goal of our review is twofold. First, we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of MWC molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands. Second, we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of MWC molecules tracks their sensory input, giving a sense of the "design" constraints faced by these receptors.},

abstract = {To explore scenarios that permit transcription regulation by activator recruitment of RNA polymerase and sigma competition in vivo, we used an equilibrium model of RNA polymerase binding to DNA constrained by the values of total RNA polymerase (E) and sigma(70) per cell measured in this work. Our numbers of E and sigma(70) per cell, which are consistent with most of the primary data in the literature, suggest that in vivo (i) only a minor fraction of RNA polymerase ({\textless}20{\%}) is involved in elongation and (ii) sigma(70) is in excess of total E. Modeling the partitioning of RNA polymerase between promoters, nonspecific DNA binding sites, and the cytoplasm suggested that even weak promoters will be saturated with Esigma(70) in vivo unless nonspecific DNA binding by Esigma(70) is rather significant. In addition, the model predicted that sigmas compete for binding to E only when their total number exceeds the total amount of RNA polymerase (excluding that involved in elongation) and that weak promoters will be preferentially subjected to sigma competition.},

abstract = {To probe the mechanism of the Hsp90 chaperone that is required for the maturation of many signaling proteins in eukaryotes, we analyzed the effects of all individual amino acid changes in the ATPase domain on yeast growth rate. The sensitivity of a position to mutation was strongly influenced by proximity to the phosphates of ATP, indicating that ATPase-driven conformational changes impose stringent physical constraints on Hsp90. To investigate how these constraints may vary for different clients, we performed biochemical analyses on a panel of Hsp90 mutants spanning the full range of observed fitness effects. We observed distinct effects of nine Hsp90 mutations on activation of v-src and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), indicating that different chaperone mechanisms can be utilized for these clients. These results provide a detailed guide for understanding Hsp90 mechanism and highlight the potential for inhibitors of Hsp90 that target a subset of clients.},

abstract = {The native Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase, E.C. 2.1.3.2) provides a classic allosteric model for the feedback inhibition of a biosynthetic pathway by its end products. Both E. coli and Erwinia herbicola possess ATCase holoenzymes which are dodecameric (2(c3):3(r2)) with 311 amino acid residues per catalytic monomer and 153 and 154 amino acid residues per regulatory (r) monomer, respectively. While the quaternary structures of the two enzymes are identical, the primary amino acid sequences have diverged by 14 {\%} in the catalytic polypeptide and 20 {\%} in the regulatory polypeptide. The amino acids proposed to be directly involved in the active site and nucleotide binding site are strictly conserved between the two enzymes; nonetheless, the two enzymes differ in their catalytic and regulatory characteristics. The E. coli enzyme has sigmoidal substrate binding with activation by ATP, and inhibition by CTP, while the E. herbicola enzyme has apparent first order kinetics at low substrate concentrations in the absence of allosteric ligands, no ATP activation and only slight CTP inhibition. In an apparently important and highly conserved characteristic, CTP and UTP impose strong synergistic inhibition on both enzymes. The co-operative binding of aspartate in the E. coli enzyme is correlated with a T-to-R conformational transition which appears to be greatly reduced in the E. herbicola enzyme, although the addition of inhibitory heterotropic ligands (CTP or CTP+UTP) re-establishes co-operative saturation kinetics. Hybrid holoenzymes assembled in vivo with catalytic subunits from E. herbicola and regulatory subunits from E. coli mimick the allosteric response of the native E. coli holoenzyme and exhibit ATP activation. The reverse hybrid, regulatory subunits from E. herbicola and catalytic subunits from E. coli, exhibited no response to ATP. The conserved structure and diverged functional characteristics of the E. herbicola enzyme provides an opportunity for a new evaluation of the common paradigm involving allosteric control of ATCase.},

abstract = {With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, many large scale experimental efforts aim to map genotypic variability among individuals. This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold-change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates. We then implement the model to analyze the sensitivity of the promoter sequence to the regulatory output, and predict the potential for regulation to evolve due to point mutations in the promoter region.},

abstract = {A mechanistic study of the poorly understood pathway by which the inhibitor acarbose is enzymatically rearranged by human pancreatic alpha-amylase has been conducted by structurally examining the binding modes of the related inhibitors isoacarbose and acarviosine-glucose, and by novel kinetic measurements of all three inhibitors under conditions that demonstrate this rearrangement process. Unlike acarbose, isoacarbose has a unique terminal alpha-(1-6) linkage to glucose and is found to be resistant to enzymatic rearrangement. This terminal glucose unit is found to bind in the +3 subsite and for the first time reveals the interactions that occur in this part of the active site cleft with certainty. These results also suggest that the +3 binding subsite may be sufficiently flexible to bind the alpha-(1-6) branch points in polysaccharide substrates, and therefore may play a role in allowing efficient cleavage in the direct vicinity of such junctures. Also found to be resistant to enzymatic rearrangement was acarviosine-glucose, which has one fewer glucose unit than acarbose. Collectively, structural studies of all three inhibitors and the specific cleavage pattern of HPA make it possible to outline the simplest sequence of enzymatic reactions likely involved upon acarbose binding. Prominent features incorporated into the starting structure of acarbose to facilitate the synthesis of the final tightly bound pseudo-pentasaccharide product are the restricted availability of hydrolyzable bonds and the placement of the transition state-like acarviosine group. Additional "in situ" experiments designed to elongate and thereby optimize isoacarbose and acarviosine-glucose inhibition using the activated substrate alphaG3F demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and that the principles outlined for acarbose rearrangement can be used to predict the final products that were obtained.},

abstract = {Sensing extracellular changes initiates signal transduction and is the first stage of cellular decision-making. Yet relatively little is known about why one form of sensing biochemistry has been selected over another. To gain insight into this question, we studied the sensing characteristics of one of the biochemically simplest of sensors: the allosteric transcription factor. Such proteins, common in microbes, directly transduce the detection of a sensed molecule to changes in gene regulation. Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, we determined six sensing characteristics--the dynamic range, the Hill number, the intrinsic noise, the information transfer capacity, the static gain, and the mean response time--as a function of the biochemical parameters of individual sensors and of the number of sensors. We found that specifying one characteristic strongly constrains others. For example, a high dynamic range implies a high Hill number and a high capacity, and vice versa. Perhaps surprisingly, these constraints are so strong that most of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameter values. Within our approximations, we can calculate the probability distribution of the numbers of input molecules that maximizes information transfer and show that a population of one hundred allosteric transcription factors can in principle distinguish between more than four bands of input concentrations. Our results imply that allosteric sensors are unlikely to have been selected for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in the performance of many.},

abstract = {We introduce a numerical scheme to evolve functional materials that can accomplish a specified mechanical task. In this scheme, the number of solutions, their spatial architectures and the correlations among them can be computed. As an example, we consider an "allosteric" task, which requires the material to respond specifically to a stimulus at a distant active site. We find that functioning materials evolve a less-constrained trumpet-shaped region connecting the stimulus and active sites and that the amplitude of the elastic response varies non-monotonically along the trumpet. As previously shown for some proteins, we find that correlations appearing during evolution alone are sufficient to identify key aspects of this design. Finally, we show that the success of this architecture stems from the emergence of soft edge modes recently found to appear near the surface of marginally connected materials. Overall, our in silico evolution experiment offers a new window to study the relationship between structure, function, and correlations emerging during evolution.},

abstract = {One emphasis of the Gibbs Conference on Biothermodynamics is the value of thermodynamic measurements for understanding behaviors of biological systems. In this study, the correlation between thermodynamic measurements of in vitro DNA binding affinity with in vivo transcription repression was investigated for two transcription repressors. In the first system, which comprised an engineered LacI/GalR homolog, mutational changes altered the equilibrium constant for binding DNA. Changes correlated with altered repression, but estimates of in vivo repressor concentration suggest a ≥25-fold discrepancy with in vitro conditions. In the second system, changes in ligand binding to BirA altered dimerization and subsequent DNA occupancy. Again, these changes correlate with altered in vivo repression, but comparison with in vitro measurements reveals a {\~{}}10-fold discrepancy. Further analysis of each system suggests that the observed discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results reflect the contributions of additional equilibria to the transcription repression process.},

abstract = {The variation among sequences and structures in nature is both determined by physical laws and by evolutionary history. However, these two factors are traditionally investigated by disciplines with different emphasis and philosophy—molecular biophysics on one hand and evolutionary population genetics in another. Here, we review recent theoretical and computational approaches that address the crucial need to integrate these two disciplines. We first articulate the elements of these approaches. Then, we survey their contribution to our mechanistic understanding of molecular evolution, the polymorphisms in coding region, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, the observed folding stability of proteins in nature, and the distribution of protein folds in genomes.},

abstract = {Visualizing the nanoscale intracellular structures formed by nucleic acids, such as chromatin, in nonperturbed, structurally and dynamically complex cellular systems, will help expand our understanding of biological processes and open the next frontier for biological discovery. Traditional superresolution techniques to visualize subdiffractional macromolecular structures formed by nucleic acids require exogenous labels that may perturb cell function and change the very molecular processes they intend to study, especially at the extremely high label densities required for superresolution. However, despite tremendous interest and demonstrated need, label-free optical superresolution imaging of nucleotide topology under native nonperturbing conditions has never been possible. Here we investigate a photoswitching process of native nucleotides and present the demonstration of subdiffraction-resolution imaging of cellular structures using intrinsic contrast from unmodified DNA based on the principle of single-molecule photon localization microscopy (PLM). Using DNA-PLM, we achieved nanoscopic imaging of interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes, allowing a quantitative analysis of the DNA occupancy level and a subdiffractional analysis of the chromosomal organization. This study may pave a new way for label-free superresolution nanoscopic imaging of macromolecular structures with nucleotide topologies and could contribute to the development of new DNA-based contrast agents for superresolution imaging.},

@article{Levantino2012a,
abstract = {The acknowledged success of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric model stems from its efficacy in accounting for the functional behavior of many complex proteins starting with hemoglobin (the paradigmatic case) and extending to channels and receptors. The kinetic aspects of the allosteric model, however, have been often neglected, with the exception of hemoglobin and a few other proteins where conformational relaxations can be triggered by a short and intense laser pulse, and monitored by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Only recently the application of time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS), a direct structurally sensitive technique, unveiled the time scale of hemoglobin quaternary structural transition. In order to test the generality of the MWC kinetic model, we carried out a TR-WAXS investigation in parallel on adult human hemoglobin and on a recombinant protein (HbYQ) carrying two mutations at the active site [Leu(B10)Tyr and His(E7)Gln]. HbYQ seemed an ideal test because, although exhibiting allosteric properties, its kinetic and structural properties are different from adult human hemoglobin. The structural dynamics of HbYQ unveiled by TR-WAXS can be quantitatively accounted for by the MWC kinetic model. Interestingly, the main structural change associated with the R-T allosteric transition (i.e., the relative rotation and translation of the dimers) is approximately 10-fold slower in HbYQ, and the drop in the allosteric transition rate with ligand saturation is steeper. Our results extend the general validity of the MWC kinetic model and reveal peculiar thermodynamic properties of HbYQ. A possible structural interpretation of the characteristic kinetic behavior of HbYQ is also discussed.},

The O(2) affinity, cooperative behavior, and the Bohr effect of hemoglobin are modulated principally by tertiary structural changes, which are induced by its interactions with heterotropic allosteric effectors. In their absence, hemoglobin is a high affinity, moderately cooperative O(2) carrier of limited functional flexibility, the behaviors of which are regulated by the homotropic, O(2)-linked T/R quaternary structural transition of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux/Perutz model. However, the interactions with allosteric effectors provide such "inert" hemoglobin unprecedented magnitudes of functional diversities not only of physiological relevance but also of extreme nature, by which hemoglobin can behave energetically beyond what can be explained by the Monod-Wyman-Changeux/Perutz model. Thus, the heterotropic effector-linked tertiary structural changes rather than the homotropic ligation-linked T/R quaternary structural transition are energetically more significant and primarily responsible for modulation of functions of hemoglobin.},

abstract = {Here, we systematically decompose the known protein structural universe into its basic elements, which we dub tertiary structural motifs (TERMs). A TERM is a compact backbone fragment that captures the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary environments around a given residue, comprising one or more disjoint segments (three on average). We seek the set of universal TERMs that capture all structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), finding remarkable degeneracy. Only ∼600 TERMs are sufficient to describe 50{\%} of the PDB at sub-Angstrom resolution. However, more rare geometries also exist, and the overall structural coverage grows logarithmically with the number of TERMs. We go on to show that universal TERMs provide an effective mapping between sequence and structure. We demonstrate that TERM-based statistics alone are sufficient to recapitulate close-to-native sequences given either NMR or X-ray backbones. Furthermore, sequence variability predicted from TERM data agrees closely with evolutionary variation. Finally, locations of TERMs in protein chains can be predicted from sequence alone based on sequence signatures emergent from TERM instances in the PDB. For multisegment motifs, this method identifies spatially adjacent fragments that are not contiguous in sequence-a major bottleneck in structure prediction. Although all TERMs recur in diverse proteins, some appear specialized for certain functions, such as interface formation, metal coordination, or even water binding. Structural biology has benefited greatly from previously observed degeneracies in structure. The decomposition of the known structural universe into a finite set of compact TERMs offers exciting opportunities toward better understanding, design, and prediction of protein structure.},

abstract = {1. We studied the electrical conductance of membrane patches detached from the outer segment of single cone photoreceptors isolated from striped bass retina. 2. Only a single class of ion channels exists in the plasma membrane of the cone outer segments; they are gated by cytoplasmic cGMP and select cations over anions, but distinguish poorly among cations. In the absence of added cGMP and of divalent cations, however, membrane patches detached from the outer segments exhibit a small conductance that ideally selects cations over anions, but distinguishes poorly between Na+ and Li+. 3. The cGMP-independent conductance does not arise from the effect of residual cGMP that may remain associated with the detached membrane, because treatment of the patch with cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase does not affect this conductance. 4. The cGMP-independent conductance is pharmacologically indistinguishable from that activated by cGMP. Ca2+ and L-cis-diltiazem block both conductances at comparable concentrations and with similar quantitative characteristics. 5. We analysed the noise of Ca(2+)- or L-cis-diltiazem-dependent macroscopic currents both in the presence and in the absence of cGMP. In the presence of cGMP, the power density spectrum of the noise is well fitted by the sum of two Lorentzian components. The same function with similar corner frequencies fits the noise of the cGMP-independent currents. However, the total power in the current fluctuations is smaller in the absence of cGMP than in its presence; also, the ratio of the zero frequency asymptotes of the low over the high frequency components, S1(0)/Sh(0), is larger in the absence of cGMP than in its presence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In particular, the M1 and M4 receptor subtypes have emerged as attractive drug targets for treatments of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, but the high conservation of the acetylcholine-binding pocket has spurred current research into targeting allosteric sites on these receptors. Here we report the crystal structures of the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors bound to the inverse agonist, tiotropium. Comparison of these structures with each other, as well as with the previously reported M2 and M3 receptor structures, reveals differences in the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites that contribute to a role in drug selectivity at this important receptor family. We also report identification of a cluster of residues that form a network linking the orthosteric and allosteric sites of the M4 receptor, which provides new insight into how allosteric modulation may be transmitted between the two spatially distinct domains.},

In the yeast microsomes used, desmethylselegiline and levomethamphetamine were formed from selegiline at significant rates. The highest contribution to the hepatic clearance of selegiline was calculated to be exerted by CYP2B6 (124 l/h) CYP2C19 (82 l/h), whereas CYP3A4 (27 l/h) and CYP1A2 (21 l/h) were of less importance. Antibodies against CYP2B6 inhibited metabolism of selegiline in microsomes containing CYP2B6 but not in microsomes without significant amounts of the enzyme. In contrast to previous reports, we could not find any role for CYP2D6 in the metabolism of selegiline. The data strongly indicate that the high extent of interindividual variation seen in vivo for selegiline clearance is caused by the metabolism of the compound by the highly polymorphic CYP2B6 and CYP2C19.},

Two allosteric transitions are observed: one at relatively low ATP concentrations ({\textless} or = 100 microM) and the second at higher concentrations of ATP with respective midpoints of about 16 and 160 microM. Two allosteric transitions were previously observed also in the case of the Arg-196--{\textgreater}Ala GroEL mutant [Yifrach, O., {\&} Horovitz, A. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 243, 397-401]. On the basis of these observations a mathematical model for nested cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis by GroEL is developed in which there are two levels of allostery: one within each ring and the second between rings. In the first level, each hepatameric ring is in equilibrium between the T and R states, in accordance with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of cooperativity [Monod et al. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118]. A second level of allostery is between the rings of the GroEL particle which undergoes sequential Koshland-N{\'{e}}methy-Filmer (KNF)-type transitions from the TT state via the TR state to the RR state [Koshland et al. (1966) Biochemistry 5, 365-385]. Using our model, we estimate the values of the Hill coefficient for the negative cooperativity between rings in wild-type GroEL and the Arg-196--{\textgreater}Ala mutant to be 0.003 (+/- 0.001) and 0.07 (+/- 0.02), respectively. The inter-ring coupling free energies in wild-type GroEL and the Arg-196--{\textgreater}Ala mutant are -7.5 (+/- 0.4) and -3.9 (+/- 0.3) kcal mol-1, respectively.},

We calculate the statistical errors of our approach and verify them with stochastic simulations. By using fluctuations over the entire photobleaching process, we obtain significantly smaller errors than previous approaches that have used fluctuations arising from cytoplasmic proteins partitioning during cellular division. From the time-dependence of the fluctuations as photobleaching proceeds, we can discriminate between desired photobleach fluctuations and background noise or photon shot noise. Our approach does not require cellular division and the photobleaching rate sets a timescale that is adjustable with respect to cellular processes. We hope that our approach will now be applied experimentally.},

abstract = {The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model was initially proposed to describe the allosteric properties of regulatory enzymes and subsequently extended to receptors. Yet despite GPCRs representing the largest family of receptors and drug targets, no study has systematically evaluated the MWC mechanism as it applies to GPCR allosteric ligands. We reveal how the recently described allosteric modulator, benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), behaves according to a strict, two-state MWC mechanism at the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). Despite having a low affinity for the M1 mAChR, BQCA demonstrated state dependence, exhibiting high positive cooperativity with orthosteric agonists in a manner that correlated with efficacy but negative cooperativity with inverse agonists. The activity of BQCA was significantly increased at a constitutively active M1 mAChR but abolished at an inactive mutant. Interestingly, BQCA possessed intrinsic signaling efficacy, ranging from near-quiescence to full agonism depending on the coupling efficiency of the chosen intracellular pathway. This latter cellular property also determined the difference in magnitude of positive cooperativity between BQCA and the orthosteric agonist, carbachol, across pathways. The lack of additional, pathway-biased, allosteric modulation by BQCA was confirmed in genetically engineered yeast strains expressing different chimeras between the endogenous yeast Gpa1 protein and human G$\alpha$ subunits. These findings define a chemical biological framework that can be applied to the study and classification of allosteric modulators across different GPCR families.},

abstract = {Genetic regulatory networks enable cells to respond to changes in internal and external conditions by dynamically coordinating their gene expression profiles. Our ability to make quantitative measurements in these biochemical circuits has deepened our understanding of what kinds of computations genetic regulatory networks can perform, and with what reliability. These advances have motivated researchers to look for connections between the architecture and function of genetic regulatory networks. Transmitting information between a network's inputs and outputs has been proposed as one such possible measure of function, relevant in certain biological contexts. Here we summarize recent developments in the application of information theory to gene regulatory networks. We first review basic concepts in information theory necessary for understanding recent work. We then discuss the functional complexity of gene regulation, which arises from the molecular nature of the regulatory interactions. We end by reviewing some experiments that support the view that genetic networks responsible for early development of multicellular organisms might be maximizing transmitted 'positional information'.},

We used mutagenesis and suppressor analyses to identify the AHL-binding domain of LuxN and discovered LuxN mutants that confer both decreased and increased AHL sensitivity. Our analysis of dose-response curves of multiple LuxN mutants pins these inverse phenotypes on quantifiable opposing shifts in the free-energy bias of LuxN for occupying its kinase and phosphatase states. To understand receptor activation and to characterize the pathway signaling parameters, we exploited a strong LuxN antagonist, one of fifteen small-molecule antagonists we identified. We find that quorum-sensing-mediated communication can be manipulated positively and negatively to control bacterial behavior and, more broadly, that signaling parameters can be deduced from in vivo data.},

abstract = {The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and selection. We show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding cooperativity between different sites. Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

abstract = {The chemotaxis network in Escherichia coli is remarkable for its sensitivity to small relative changes in the concentrations of multiple chemical signals over a broad range of ambient concentrations. Key to this sensitivity is an adaptation system that relies on methylation and demethylation (or deamidation) of specific modification sites of the chemoreceptors by the enzymes CheR and CheB, respectively. It was recently discovered that these enzymes can access five to seven receptors when tethered to a particular receptor. We show that these "assistance neighborhoods" are necessary for precise adaptation in a model for signaling by clusters of chemoreceptors. In agreement with experiment, model clusters composed of receptors of different types exhibit high sensitivity and precise adaptation over a wide range of chemical concentrations and the response of adapted clusters to addition/removal of attractant scales with free-energy change. We predict two limits of precise adaptation at large attractant concentrations: Either receptors reach full methylation and turn off, or receptors become saturated and cease to respond to attractant but retain their adapted activity.},

It was soon extended to pharmacological receptors for neurotransmitters and other macromolecular entities involved in intracellular and intercellular communications. Five decades later, the two main hypotheses of the model are reexamined on the basis of a variety of regulatory proteins with known X-ray structures: (a) Regulatory proteins possess an oligomeric structure with symmetry properties, and (b) the allosteric interactions between topographically distinct sites are mediated by a conformational transition established between a few preestablished states with conservation of symmetry and ligand-directed conformational selection. Several well-documented examples are adequately represented by the MWC model, yet a few possible exceptions are noted. New questions are raised concerning the dynamics of the allosteric transitions and more complex supramolecular ensembles.},

abstract = {ATP is a potent inhibitor of the activity of fumarase from yeast and pig heart (Ki = 0.005 mm and 0.03 mm, respectively). There is a sigmoid relation between the inhibition and the ATP concentration provided that Mg2+ is present. The sigmoid relationship is shown to be due simply to the fact that the MgATP complex does not inhibit, so that with increasing ATP concentration, the inhibition is not fully expressed until Mg2+ is titrated by ATP. Since several other enzymes in energy yielding pathways are known to be inhibited by free ATP but not by MgATP, this type of sigmoidal response is probably an important factor in sharpening feedback responses to ATP.The inhibition by ATP is increased at low pH, suggesting that ATPH3- may be a better inhibitor than ATP4-. Moreover, the ability of magnesium to diminish the inhibition is reduced at low pH, as would be expected from the fact that ATPH3- has a lower affinity than ATP4- for Mg2+. These phenomena may profoundly affect the metabolic consequences of intracellular cation movements, i.e. exchange of Mg2+ for H+ between two compartments such as mitochondria and cytosol would result in the liberation of ATP from MgATP in one compartment and binding of ATP in the other, producing inverse metabolic effects in the two compartments.},

Native olfactory CNG channels are heterotetramers of CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b subunits. Upon heterologous expression, only CNGA2 subunits can form functional homotetrameric channels. It is presently not known how the binding of the ligands to the four subunits is translated to channel opening. We studied activation of olfactory CNG channels by photolysis-induced jumps of cGMP or cAMP, two cyclic nucleotides with markedly different apparent affinity. It is shown that at equal degree of activation, the activation time course of homotetrameric channels is similar with cGMP and cAMP and it is also similar in homo- and heterotetrameric channels with the same cyclic nucleotide. Kinetic models were globally fitted to activation time courses of homotetrameric channels. While all models containing equivalent binding sites failed, a model containing three binding sites with a ligand affinity high-low-high described the data adequately. Only the second binding step switches from a very low to a very high open probability. We propose a unique gating mechanism for homotetrameric and heterotetrameric channels that involves only three highly cooperative binding steps.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels bind agonists with higher affinity in the open than in the closed state. The kinetic basis of this increased affinity has remained unknown, because even though the rate constants of agonist association to and dissociation from closed receptors can be estimated with reasonable certainty, the kinetics of the binding steps in open receptors have proven to be elusive. To be able to measure the agonist-dissociation rate constant from open muscle nicotinic receptors, we increased the probability of ligand unbinding from the open state by engineering a number of mutations that speed up opening and slow down closing but leave the ligand-binding properties unchanged. Single-channel patch-clamp recordings from the wild-type and mutant constructs were performed at very low concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh). The durations of individual channel activations were analyzed assuming that "bursts" of fully liganded (diliganded) receptor openings can be terminated by ligand dissociation from the closed or open state (followed by fast closure) or by desensitization. This analysis revealed that ACh dissociates from diliganded open receptors at approximately 24 s(-1), that is, approximately 2,500 times more slowly than from diliganded closed receptors. This change alone without a concomitant change in the association rate constant to the open state quantitatively accounts for the increased equilibrium affinity of the open channel for ACh. Also, the results predict that both desensitization and ACh dissociation from the open state frequently terminate bursts of openings in naturally occurring gain-of-function mutants (which cause slow-channel congenital myasthenia) and therefore would contribute significantly to the time course of the endplate current decay in these disease conditions.},

With significant improvements in sequencing efficiency and throughput, a wealth of genotypic data has become available. However the translation of this information into concrete advances in diagnostic and clinical setups has proved far more challenging. Two major reasons for this are the lack of functional annotation for genomic variants and the complex nature of genotype-to-phenotype relationships. One fundamental approach to bypass these issues is to examine the effects of genetic variation at the level of proteins as they are directly involved in carrying out biological functions. Within the cell, proteins function by interacting with other proteins as a part of an underlying interactome network. This network can be determined using interactome mapping - a combination of high-throughput experimental toolkits and curation from small-scale studies. Integrating structural information from co-crystals with the network allows generation of a structurally resolved network. Within the context of this network, the structural principles of disease mutations can be examined and used to generate reliable mechanistic hypotheses regarding disease pathogenesis.},

The catalytic mechanism for the entry of Pcho in both sites and Zn(2+) or Mg(2+) follows a random sequential mechanism. However, Zn(2+) is more effective than Mg(2+) at alleviating the inhibition produced by the entry of Pcho or different AACs in the inhibitory site. We postulate that Zn(2+) induces a conformational change in the active center that is communicated to the inhibitory site, producing a compact or closed structure. In contrast, Mg(2+) produces a relaxed or open conformation.},

abstract = {Cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) to promoters and other regulatory regions is essential for precise gene expression. The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions between TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TF sites in regulatory regions. Recent genomic and functional studies, however, demonstrate a great deal of flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and identities of TF sites located in cis-regulatory regions. Such flexibility is inconsistent with cooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here, we demonstrate that strong cooperativity among noninteracting TFs can be achieved by their competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is analogous to cooperativity in another multimolecular complex: hemoglobin. This surprising analogy provides deep insights, with parallels between the heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g., the Bohr effect) and the roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin modifications in gene expression. Nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is consistent with several experimental studies, is equally applicable to repressors and activators, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity of regulatory regions, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary observations. Striking parallels between cooperativity in hemoglobin and in transcriptional regulation point to a general mechanism that can be used in various biological systems.},

abstract = {A central aim of cell biology was to understand the strategy of gene expression in response to the environment. Here, we study gene expression response to metabolic challenges in exponentially growing Escherichia coli using mass spectrometry. Despite enormous complexity in the details of the underlying regulatory network, we find that the proteome partitions into several coarse-grained sectors, with each sector's total mass abundance exhibiting positive or negative linear relations with the growth rate. The growth rate-dependent components of the proteome fractions comprise about half of the proteome by mass, and their mutual dependencies can be characterized by a simple flux model involving only two effective parameters. The success and apparent generality of this model arises from tight coordination between proteome partition and metabolism, suggesting a principle for resource allocation in proteome economy of the cell. This strategy of global gene regulation should serve as a basis for future studies on gene expression and constructing synthetic biological circuits. Coarse graining may be an effective approach to derive predictive phenomenological models for other 'omics' studies.},

Many such models are "sloppy," i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher information matrix, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

Comparison of this sequence with the first 87 residues of the NH2-terminal sequence of the alpha chain of hemocyanin from the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, of the Western Pacific (Nemoto, T., and Takagi, T.

This conclusion is supported by our finding that 40{\%} of the residues in the sequence 172-186 are identical to residues 188-202 in tyrosinase from Neurospora; residues 188 and 193 in tyrosinase are known to be copper-binding histidines (Pfiffner, E., and Lerch, K.

abstract = {Models of transcription are often built around a picture of RNA polymerase and transcription factors (TFs) acting on a single copy of a promoter. However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number-in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle.},

abstract = {One of the paramount goals of synthetic biology is to have the ability to tune transcriptional networks to targeted levels of expression at will. As a step in that direction, we have constructed a set of 18 unique binding sites for E. coli RNA Polymerase (RNAP) $\delta$⁷⁰ holoenzyme, designed using a model of sequence-dependent binding energy combined with a thermodynamic model of transcription to produce a targeted level of gene expression. This promoter set allows us to determine the correspondence between the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules or protein products and the predicted promoter binding energies measured in k(B)T energy units. These binding sites adhere on average to the predicted level of gene expression over 3 orders of magnitude in constitutive gene expression, to within a factor of 3 in both protein and mRNA copy number. With these promoters in hand, we then place them under the regulatory control of a bacterial repressor and show that again there is a strict correspondence between the measured and predicted levels of expression, demonstrating the transferability of the promoters to an alternate regulatory context. In particular, our thermodynamic model predicts the expression from our promoters under a range of repressor concentrations between several per cell up to over 100 per cell. After correcting the predicted polymerase binding strength using the data from the unregulated promoter, the thermodynamic model accurately predicts the expression for the simple repression strains to within 30{\%}. Demonstration of modular promoter design, where parts of the circuit (such as RNAP/TF binding strength and transcription factor copy number) can be independently chosen from a stock list and combined to give a predictable result, has important implications as an engineering tool for use in synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disorder characterized by both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Recent transcriptomics studies related to T2DM have revealed changes in expression of a large number of metabolic genes in a variety of tissues. Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying these transcriptional changes and their impact on the cellular metabolic phenotype is a challenging task due to the complexity of transcriptional regulation and the highly interconnected nature of the metabolic network. In this study we integrate skeletal muscle gene expression datasets with human metabolic network reconstructions to identify key metabolic regulatory features of T2DM. These features include reporter metabolites--metabolites with significant collective transcriptional response in the associated enzyme-coding genes, and transcription factors with significant enrichment of binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes. In addition to metabolites from TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid metabolism (known to be associated with T2DM), we identified several reporter metabolites representing novel biomarker candidates. For example, the highly connected metabolites NAD+/NADH and ATP/ADP were also identified as reporter metabolites that are potentially contributing to the widespread gene expression changes observed in T2DM. An algorithm based on the analysis of the promoter regions of the genes associated with reporter metabolites revealed a transcription factor regulatory network connecting several parts of metabolism. The identified transcription factors include members of the CREB, NRF1 and PPAR family, among others, and represent regulatory targets for further experimental analysis. Overall, our results provide a holistic picture of key metabolic and regulatory nodes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM.},

Thermodynamic models have been proposed as a tool to describe the expression levels of a given transcriptional circuit. In this context, it is essential to understand both the limitations and linear range of the different methods for measuring gene expression and to determine to what extent measurements from different reporters can be directly compared with one aim being the stringent testing of theoretical descriptions of gene expression. In this article, we compare two protein reporters by measuring both the absolute level of expression and fold-change in expression using the fluorescent protein EYFP and the enzymatic reporter $\beta$-galactosidase. We determine their dynamic and linear range and show that they are interchangeable for measuring mean levels of expression over four orders of magnitude. By calibrating these reporters such that they can be interpreted in terms of absolute molecular counts, we establish limits for their applicability: autofluorescence on the lower end of expression for EYFP (at ∼10 molecules per cell) and interference with cellular growth on the high end for $\beta$-galactosidase (at ∼20,000 molecules per cell). These qualities make the reporters complementary and necessary when trying to experimentally verify the predictions from the theoretical models.},

abstract = {Many signaling and metabolic pathways rely on the ability of some of the proteins involved to undergo a substrate-induced transition between at least two structural states. Among the various models put forward to account for binding and activity curves of those allosteric proteins, the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model for allostery theory has certainly been the most influential, although a central postulate, the preexisting equilibrium between the low-activity, low-affinity quaternary structure and the high-activity, high-affinity quaternary structure states in the absence of substrates, has long awaited direct experimental substantiation. Upon substrate binding, allosteric Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase adopts alternate quaternary structures, stabilized by a set of interdomain and intersubunit interactions, which are readily differentiated by their solution x-ray scattering curves. Disruption of a salt link, which is observed only in the low-activity, low-affinity quaternary structure, between Lys-143 of the regulatory chain and Asp-236 of the catalytic chain yields a mutant enzyme that is in a reversible equilibrium between at least two states in the absence of ligand, a major tenet of the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model. By using this mutant as a magnifying glass of the structural effect of ligand binding, a comparative analysis of the binding of carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and analogs points out the crucial role of the amine group of CP in facilitating the transition toward the high-activity, high-affinity quaternary state. Thus, the cooperative binding of aspartate in aspartate transcarbamoylase appears to result from the combination of the preexisting quaternary structure equilibrium with local changes induced by CP binding.},

abstract = {Many ion channels exhibit a slow stochastic switching between distinct modes of gating activity. This feature of channel behavior has pronounced implications for the dynamics of ionic currents and the signaling pathways that they regulate. A canonical example is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channel, whose regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration is essential for numerous cellular processes. However, the underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to modal gating in this and most other channels remain unknown. Although ion channels are composed of protein subunits, previous mathematical models of modal gating are coarse grained at the level of whole-channel states, limiting further dialogue between theory and experiment. Here we propose an origin for modal gating, by modeling the kinetics of ligand binding and conformational change in the IP3R at the subunit level. We find good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of ligand concentrations, accounting for equilibrium channel properties, transient responses to changing ligand conditions, and modal gating statistics. We show how this can be understood within a simple analytical framework and confirm our results with stochastic simulations. The model assumes that channel subunits are independent, demonstrating that cooperative binding or concerted conformational changes are not required for modal gating. Moreover, the model embodies a generally applicable principle: If a timescale separation exists in the kinetics of individual subunits, then modal gating can arise as an emergent property of channel behavior.},

abstract = {The 306-kDa aspartate transcarbamoylase is a well studied regulatory enzyme, and it has emerged as a paradigm for understanding allostery and cooperative binding processes. Although there is a consensus that the cooperative binding of active site ligands follows the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, there is some debate about the binding of effectors such as ATP and CTP and how they influence the allosteric equilibrium between R and T states of the enzyme. In this article, the binding of substrates, substrate analogues, and nucleotides is studied, along with their effect on the R-T equilibrium by using highly deuterated, (1)H,(13)C-methyl-labeled protein in concert with methyl-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR. Although only the T state of the enzyme can be observed in spectra of wild-type unliganded aspartate transcarbamoylase, binding of active-site substrates shift the equilibrium so that correlations from the R state become visible, allowing the equilibrium constant (L') between ligand-saturated R and T forms of the enzyme to be measured quantitatively. The equilibrium constant between unliganded R and T forms (L) also is obtained, despite the fact that the R state is "invisible" in spectra, by means of an indirect process that makes use of relations that emerge from the fact that ligand binding and the R-T equilibrium are linked. Titrations with MgATP unequivocally establish that its binding directly perturbs the R-T equilibrium, consistent with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. This study emphasizes the utility of modern solution NMR spectroscopy in understanding protein function, even for systems with aggregate molecular masses in the hundreds of kilodaltons.},

Therefore, we studied homocysteine metabolism in 72 patients presenting before the age of 55 years with occlusive arterial disease of cerebral, carotid, or aorto-iliac vessels. Twenty patients (28{\%}) had basal homocysteinemia; and 26 patients (36{\%}) had abnormal increases of plasma homocysteine after peroral methionine loading, which exceeded the highest value for 46 comparable controls and was within the range for 20 obligate heterozygotes for homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency. Basal plasma homocysteine content was strongly and negatively correlated to vitamin B12 and folate concentrations. Plasma PLP was depressed in most patients but there was no correlation between PLP and homocysteine values. In 20 patients, treatment with pyridoxine hydrochloride (240 mg/day) and folic acid (10 mg/day) reduced fasting homocysteine after 4 weeks by a mean of 53{\%}, and methionine response by a mean of 39{\%}. These data show that a substantial proportion of patients with early-onset vascular disease have impaired homocysteine metabolism, which may contribute to vascular disease, and that the impaired metabolism can be improved easily and without side effects.},

abstract = {In bacteria such as Escherichia coli, DNA is compacted into a nucleoid near the cell center, whereas ribosomes-molecular complexes that translate mRNAs into proteins-are mainly localized to the poles. We study the impact of this spatial organization using a minimal reaction-diffusion model for the cellular transcriptional-translational machinery. Although genome-wide mRNA-nucleoid segregation still lacks experimental validation, our model predicts that [Formula: see text] of mRNAs are segregated to the poles. In addition, our analysis reveals a "circulation" of ribosomes driven by the flux of mRNAs, from synthesis in the nucleoid to degradation at the poles. We show that our results are robust with respect to multiple, biologically relevant factors, such as mRNA degradation by RNase enzymes, different phases of the cell division cycle and growth rates, and the existence of nonspecific, transient interactions between ribosomes and mRNAs. Finally, we confirm that the observed nucleoid size stems from a balance between the forces that the chromosome and mRNAs exert on each other. This suggests a potential global feedback circuit in which gene expression feeds back on itself via nucleoid compaction.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channels at neuromuscular synapses rarely open in the absence of agonists, but many different mutations increase the unliganded gating equilibrium constant (E0) to generate AChRs that are active constitutively. We measured E0 for two different sets of mutant combinations and by extrapolation estimated E0 for wild-type AChRs. The estimates were 7.6 and 7.8×10(-7) in adult-type mouse AChRs (-100 mV at 23°C). The values are in excellent agreement with one obtained previously by using a completely different method (6.5×10(-7), from monoliganded gating). E0 decreases with depolarization to the same extent as does the diliganded gating equilibrium constant, e-fold with ∼60 mV. We estimate that at -100 mV the intrinsic energy of the unliganded gating isomerization is +8.4 kcal/mol (35 kJ/mol), and that in the absence of a membrane potential, the intrinsic chemical energy of this global conformational change is +9.4 kcal/mol (39 kJ/mol). Na+ and K+ in the extracellular solution have no measureable effect on E0, which suggests that unliganded gating occurs with only water occupying the transmitter binding sites. The results are discussed with regard to the energy changes in receptor activation and the competitive antagonism of ions in agonist binding.},

In this study, Arg-243 was replaced by alanine using techniques of site-specific mutagenesis and the cloned pig kidney enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli. Compared with wild-type enzyme, kinetic parameters of the altered enzyme characterizing catalytic efficiency, magnesium binding, and inhibition by AMP differed but by less than an order of magnitude; affinity for substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 10-fold poorer, and affinity for inhibitor fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was 1000-fold poorer. Molecular dynamics simulations were undertaken to determine possible alterations in active sites of the enzyme due to replacement of Arg-243 by Ala and suggested that in the mutant enzyme loss of one cationic group leads to reorganization of the active site especially involving lysine residues 269 and 274. The differences in properties of the mutant enzyme indicate the key importance of Arg-243 in the function of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and confirm on a functional basis the shared active site in this important metabolic enzyme.},

Thus, slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome AChRs at the neuromuscular junction are likely to be activated both by steady exposure to serum choline and by transient exposure to synaptically released transmitter. Single-channel kinetic analyses indicate that the increased response to choline is caused by a reduced intrinsic stability of the closed channel. The results suggest that a mutation that destabilizes the inactive conformation of the AChR, together with the sustained exposure of endplates to serum choline, results in continuous channel activity that contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease.},

abstract = {Fitness landscapes of drug resistance constitute powerful tools to elucidate mutational pathways of antibiotic escape. Here, we developed a predictive biophysics-based fitness landscape of trimethoprim (TMP) resistance for Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We investigated the activity, binding, folding stability, and intracellular abundance for a complete set of combinatorial DHFR mutants made out of three key resistance mutations and extended this analysis to DHFR originated from Chlamydia muridarum and Listeria grayi. We found that the acquisition of TMP resistance via decreased drug affinity is limited by a trade-off in catalytic efficiency. Protein stability is concurrently affected by the resistant mutants, which precludes a precise description of fitness from a single molecular trait. Application of the kinetic flux theory provided an accurate model to predict resistance phenotypes (IC50) quantitatively from a unique combination of the in vitro protein molecular properties. Further, we found that a controlled modulation of the GroEL/ES chaperonins and Lon protease levels affects the intracellular steady-state concentration of DHFR in a mutation-specific manner, whereas IC50 is changed proportionally, as indeed predicted by the model. This unveils a molecular rationale for the pleiotropic role of the protein quality control machinery on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, which, as we illustrate here, may drastically confound the evolutionary outcome. These results provide a comprehensive quantitative genotype-phenotype map for the essential enzyme that serves as an important target of antibiotic and anticancer therapies.},

abstract = {Transient spine enlargement (3- to 5-min timescale) is an important event associated with the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Many of the molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient spine expansion in response to calcium influx caused by NMDA receptor activation. We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in signaling networks, and their role is to control both the activation and the inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume). Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), RhoA, and Cdc42, and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodeling events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics. We also generate experimentally testable predictions about the role of different components and parameters of the network on spine dynamics.},

@article{Lipscomb2012,
abstract = {Enzymes catalyze a particular reaction in cells, but only a few control the rate of this reaction and the metabolic pathway that follows. One specific mechanism for such enzymatic control of a metabolic pathway involves molecular feedback, whereby a metabolite further down the pathway acts at a unique site on the control enzyme to alter its activity allosterically. This regulation may be positive or negative (or both), depending upon the particular system. Another method of enzymatic control involves the cooperative binding of the substrate, which allows a large change in enzyme activity to emanate from only a small change in substrate concentration. Allosteric regulation and homotropic cooperativity are often known to involve significant conformational changes in the structure of the protein. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) is the textbook example of an enzyme that regulates a metabolic pathway, namely, pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, by feedback control and by the cooperative binding of the substrate, L-aspartate. The catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of this enzyme have been extensively studied. A series of X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence and absence of substrates, products, and analogues have provided details, at the molecular level, of the conformational changes that the enzyme undergoes as it shifts between its low-activity, low-affinity form (T state) to its high-activity, high-affinity form (R state). These structural data provide insights into not only how this enzyme catalyzes the reaction between l-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate, but also how the allosteric effectors modulate this activity. In this Account, we summarize studies on the structure of the enzyme and describe how these structural data provide insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. The ATCase-catalyzed reaction is regulated by nucleotide binding some 60 {\AA} from the active site, inducing structural alterations that modulate catalytic activity. The delineation of the structure and function in this particular model system will help in understanding the molecular basis of cooperativity and allosteric regulation in other systems as well.},

Looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a mechanism to regulate the average properties of transcription and its fluctuations.},

We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

The forward isomerization, which begins at the transmitter binding sites and propagates approximately 50 A to the narrow region of the pore, occurs by approximately the same sequence of molecular events with or without agonists present at the binding sites. To pinpoint the forces that govern the R versus R* agonist affinity ratio, we measured single-channel activation parameters for apo-receptors having combinations of mutations of 10 transmitter binding site residues in the alpha (Y93, G147, W149, G153, Y190, C192, and Y198), epsilon (W55 and P121), or delta (W57) subunit. Gating energy changes were largest for the tryptophan residues. The alphaW149 energy changes were coupled with those of the other aromatic amino acids. Mutating the aromatic residues to Phe reduces the R/R* equilibrium dissociation constant ratio, with alphaY190 and alphaW149 being the most sensitive positions. Most of the mutations eliminated long-lived spontaneous openings. The results provide a foundation for understanding how ligands trigger protein conformational change.},

These mutant proteins are present at moderately reduced intracellular levels, but their specific activities are much lower than that of wild type.},

abstract = {Amber mutations have been constructed at 328 positions, corresponding to residues 2 to 329 in the E. coli lac repressor protein. Synthetic and naturally occurring nonsense suppressors have been used to insert, in series, 12-13 amino acids at positions specified by an amber (UAG) codon in the lacI mRNA. The resulting set of over 4000 single amino acid replacements in the lac repressor protein allows a detailed analysis of its substitution tolerance along the linear array of residues, and reveals structure-function relationships in lac repressor and in proteins in general. (1) There are two main regions in the repressor which are extremely sensitive to amino acid replacements. One, the amino-terminal 59 residues, has been implicated in DNA and operator binding by a large body of work. The second, extending from approximately residues 239 to 289/292, forms the repressor core and shares the most homology with other repressor and DNA binding proteins. (2) Throughout the rest of the protein, segments of 6 to 14 amino acids, which are highly tolerant to single amino acid replacements, appear to act as "spacers" between one or several hydrophobic residues that are relatively intolerant to substitutions. (3) We have replaced the amino acids in these tolerant regions with spans of alanine residues, from 5 to 13 amino acids. In all five of the regions tested, alanine replacements, sometimes of up to 8 amino acids, still allowed functional repressor, while deletion of the same residues destroyed repressor function. This reinforces the view that many regions of a protein do not require a specific sequence to serve as spacers between more important residues. (4) A distinct pattern of substitutions leading to the I(s) phenotype suggests the location of residues involved in inducer binding. (5) A number of general substitution patterns can be recognized. For instance, proline is not tolerated at over 40 sites which tolerate all the other amino acid replacements. Another set of sites tolerates only non-polar amino acids, whereas a third set tolerates a subset of the smallest amino acids, (serine, alanine, glycine and cysteine, and sometimes threonine and valine). (5) Overall, 93 of 328 sites (28{\%}) tolerate all 13 amino acids tested, and 144 of 328 (44{\%}) tolerate 12/13 or all 13 substitutions. We judge that 192 of 328 sites (59{\%}) are generally tolerant to substitutions.},

The cytoskeleton governs the internal positioning and movement of vesicles and organelles, and controls dynamic changes in cell polarity, shape, and movement. Many of these processes require tight control of the size and shape of cytoskeletal structures, which is achieved despite rapid turnover of their molecular components. Here, we review mechanisms by which cells control the size of filamentous cytoskeletal structures from the point of view of simple quantitative models that take into account stochastic dynamics of their assembly and disassembly. Significantly, these models make experimentally testable predictions that distinguish different mechanisms of length-control.

abstract = {The acknowledged success of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric model stems from its efficacy in accounting for the functional behavior of many complex proteins starting with hemoglobin (the paradigmatic case) and extending to channels and receptors. The kinetic aspects of the allosteric model, however, have been often neglected, with the exception of hemoglobin and a few other proteins where conformational relaxations can be triggered by a short and intense laser pulse, and monitored by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Only recently the application of time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS), a direct structurally sensitive technique, unveiled the time scale of hemoglobin quaternary structural transition. In order to test the generality of the MWC kinetic model, we carried out a TR-WAXS investigation in parallel on adult human hemoglobin and on a recombinant protein (HbYQ) carrying two mutations at the active site [Leu(B10)Tyr and His(E7)Gln]. HbYQ seemed an ideal test because, although exhibiting allosteric properties, its kinetic and structural properties are different from adult human hemoglobin. The structural dynamics of HbYQ unveiled by TR-WAXS can be quantitatively accounted for by the MWC kinetic model. Interestingly, the main structural change associated with the R-T allosteric transition (i.e., the relative rotation and translation of the dimers) is approximately 10-fold slower in HbYQ, and the drop in the allosteric transition rate with ligand saturation is steeper. Our results extend the general validity of the MWC kinetic model and reveal peculiar thermodynamic properties of HbYQ. A possible structural interpretation of the characteristic kinetic behavior of HbYQ is also discussed.},

abstract = {The Michaelis-Menten equation provides a hundred-year-old prediction by which any increase in the rate of substrate unbinding will decrease the rate of enzymatic turnover. Surprisingly, this prediction was never tested experimentally nor was it scrutinized using modern theoretical tools. Here we show that unbinding may also speed up enzymatic turnover--turning a spotlight to the fact that its actual role in enzymatic catalysis remains to be determined experimentally. Analytically constructing the unbinding phase space, we identify four distinct categories of unbinding: inhibitory, excitatory, superexcitatory, and restorative. A transition in which the effect of unbinding changes from inhibitory to excitatory as substrate concentrations increase, and an overlooked tradeoff between the speed and efficiency of enzymatic reactions, are naturally unveiled as a result. The theory presented herein motivates, and allows the interpretation of, groundbreaking experiments in which existing single-molecule manipulation techniques will be adapted for the purpose of measuring enzymatic turnover under a controlled variation of unbinding rates. As we hereby show, these experiments will not only shed first light on the role of unbinding but will also allow one to determine the time distribution required for the completion of the catalytic step in isolation from the rest of the enzymatic turnover cycle.},

abstract = {The methodology adopted by Michaelis and Menten in 1913 is still routinely used to characterize the catalytic power and selectivity of enzymes. These kinetic measurements must be performed soon after the purified enzyme is mixed with a large excess of substrate. Other time scales and solution compositions are no less physiologically relevant, but fall outside the range of applicability of the classical formalism. Here we show that the complete picture of an enzyme's mode of function is critically obscured by the limited scope of conventional kinetic analysis, even in the simplest case of a single active site without inhibition. This picture is now unveiled in a mathematically closed form that remains valid over the reaction time for all combinations of enzyme/substrate concentrations and rate constants. Algebraic simplicity is maintained in the new formalism when stationary reaction phases are considered. By achieving this century-old objective, the otherwise hidden role of the reversible binding step is revealed and atypical kinetic profiles are explained. Most singular kinetic behaviors are identified in a critical region of conditions that coincide with typical cell conditions. Because it is not covered by the Michaelis-Menten model, the critical region has been missed until now by low- and high-throughput screenings of new drugs. New possibilities are therefore raised for novel and once-promising inhibitors to therapeutically target enzymes.},

Ackers. 1985. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.82:5347-5351). The approach taken here is an application of the general principle of hierarchical levels of allosteric control, or nesting, as suggested by Wyman (Wyman, J. 1972. Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 6:207-223). The model is an extension of the simple two-state MWC model (Monod, J., J. Wyman, and J.P. Changeux. 1965. J. Mol. Biol. 12:88-118) using the idea of cooperative binding within the T (deoxy) form of the macromolecule, and has recently been described as a "cooperon" model (Di Cera, E. 1985. Ph.D. thesis). The T-state cooperative binding is described using simple interaction rules first devised by Pauling (Pauling, L. 1935. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 21:186-191). In this application three parameters suffice to describe the cooperative free-energies of the 10 ligated species of cyanomet hemoglobin. The redox process in the presence of cyanide, represented as a Hill plot, is simulated from Smith and Ackers' cooperative free-energies and is compared with available electrochemical binding measurements.},

Here, we show that adaptation to a physiologically distinct class of ligand specificity in a PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain preferentially occurs through class-bridging intermediate mutations located distant from the ligand-binding site. These mutations provide a functional link between ligand classes and demonstrate the principle of "conditional neutrality" in mediating evolutionary adaptation. Structures show that class-bridging mutations work allosterically to open up conformational plasticity at the active site, permitting novel functions while retaining existing function. More generally, the class-bridging phenotype arises from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved network of coevolving amino acids in the PDZ family (the sector) that connects the active site to distant surface sites. These findings introduce the concept that allostery in proteins could have its origins not in protein function but in the capacity to adapt.},

The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements.

This allows, in principle, the fast components to be eliminated, resulting in a simplified description of the system's behaviour. Similar ideas have been widely used in different areas of biology, including enzyme kinetics, protein allostery, receptor pharmacology, gene regulation and post-translational modification. However, the methods used have been independent and ad hoc. In the present study, we review the use of time-scale separation as a means to simplify the description of molecular complexity and discuss recent work setting out a single framework that unifies these separate calculations. The framework offers new capabilities for mathematical analysis and helps to do justice to Michaelis and Menten's insights about individual enzymes in the context of multi-enzyme biological systems.},

abstract = {Two-component systems, which are comprised of a single histidine-aspartate phosphotransfer module, are the dominant signaling pathways in bacteria and have recently been identified in several eukaryotic organisms as well. A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3−-activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3− activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

Responding to fold change requires that the system senses signal on a logarithmic scale, responding identically to a change in signal level from 1 to 3, or from 10 to 30. It is an ongoing search in the field to understand the ways in which a logarithmic sensor can be implemented at the molecular level. In this work, we present evidence that logarithmic sensing can be implemented with a single protein, by means of allosteric regulation. Specifically, we find that mathematical models show that allosteric proteins can respond to stimuli on a logarithmic scale. Next, we present evidence from measurements in the literature that some allosteric proteins do operate in a parameter regime that permits logarithmic sensing. Finally, we present examples suggesting that allosteric proteins are indeed used in this capacity: allosteric proteins play a prominent role in systems where fold-change detection has been proposed. This finding suggests a role as logarithmic sensors for the many allosteric proteins across diverse biological processes.},

abstract = {Here, we report high-resolution X-ray structures of Bacillus subtilis aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase), an enzyme that catalyzes one of the first reactions in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. Structures of the enzyme have been determined in the absence of ligands, in the presence of the substrate carbamoyl phosphate, and in the presence of the bisubstrate/transition state analog N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate. Combining the structural data with in silico docking and electrostatic calculations, we have been able to visualize each step in the catalytic cycle of ATCase, from the ordered binding of the substrates, to the formation and decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate, to the ordered release of the products from the active site. Analysis of the conformational changes associated with these steps provides a rationale for the lack of cooperativity in trimeric ATCases that do not possess regulatory subunits.},

abstract = {Cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was purified to apparent homogeneity from the leaves of apple, a sorbitol synthesizing species. The enzyme was a homotetramer with a subunit mass of 37 kDa, and was highly specific for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) with a Km of 3.1 micro M and a Vmax of 48 units (mg protein)(-1). Either Mg2+ or Mn2+ was required for its activity with a Km of 0.59 mM and 62 micro M, respectively. Li+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+ inhibited whereas Mn2+ enhanced the Mg2+ activated enzyme activity. Fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) was found to be a mixed type inhibitor with a Ki of 0.47 mM. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) competitively inhibited the enzyme activity and changed the substrate saturation curve from hyperbolic to sigmoidal. AMP was a non-competitive inhibitor for the enzyme. F6P interacted with F2,6BP and AMP in a synergistic way to inhibit the enzyme activity. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate slightly inhibited the enzyme activity in the presence or absence of F2,6BP. Sorbitol increased the susceptibility of the enzyme to the inhibition by high concentrations of F1,6BP. High concentrations of sorbitol in the reaction mixture led to a reduction in the enzyme activity.},

The inherent complexity of even the simplest biological systems, however, often precludes achieving such predictive power. A prototypical example is the lac operon, one of the best-characterized genetic systems, which still poses serious challenges for understanding the results of combining its parts into novel setups. The reason is the pervasive complex hierarchy of events involved in gene regulation that extend from specific protein–DNA interactions to the combinatorial assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we integrate such complexity into a few-parameter model to accurately predict gene expression from a few simple rules to connect the parts.

abstract = {Allosteric proteins have great potential in synthetic biology, but our limited understanding of the molecular underpinnings of allostery has hindered the development of designer molecules, including transcription factors with new DNA-binding or ligand-binding specificities that respond appropriately to inducers. Such allosteric proteins could function as novel switches in complex circuits, metabolite sensors, or as orthogonal regulators for independent, inducible control of multiple genes. Advances in DNA synthesis and next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the assessment of millions of mutants in a single experiment, providing new opportunities to study allostery. Using the classic LacI protein as an example, we describe a genetic selection system using a bidirectional reporter to capture mutants in both allosteric states, allowing the positions most crucial for allostery to be identified. This approach is not limited to bacterial transcription factors, and could reveal new mechanistic insights and facilitate engineering of other major classes of allosteric proteins such as nuclear receptors, two-component systems, G protein-coupled receptors, and protein kinases.},

abstract = {The spontaneous activity of adult mouse muscle acetylcholine receptor channels, transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, was studied with the patch-clamp technique. To increase the frequency of unliganded openings, mutations at the 12' position of the second transmembrane segment were engineered. Our results indicate that: (a) in both wild type and mutants, a C {\textless}--{\textgreater} O kinetic scheme provides a good description of spontaneous gating. In the case of some mutant constructs, however, additional states were needed to improve the fit to the data. Similar additional states were also needed in one of six patches containing wild-type acetylcholine receptor channels; (b) the delta12' residue makes a more pronounced contribution to unliganded gating than the homologous residues of the alpha, beta, and straightepsilon subunits; (c) combinations of second transmembrane segment 12' mutations in the four different subunits appear to have cumulative effects; (d) the volume of the side chain at delta12' is relevant because residues larger than the wild-type Ser increase spontaneous gating; (e) the voltage dependence of the unliganded gating equilibrium constant is the same as that of diliganded gating, but the voltage dependences of the opening and closing rate constants are opposite (this indicates that the reaction pathway connecting the closed and open states of the receptor changes upon ligation); (f) engineering binding-site mutations that decrease diliganded gating (alphaY93F, alphaY190W, and alphaD200N) reduces spontaneous activity as well (this suggests that even in the absence of ligand the opening of the channel is accompanied by a conformational change at the binding sites); and (g) the diliganded gating equilibrium constant is also increased by the 12' mutations. Such increase is independent of the particular ligand used as the agonist, which suggests that these mutations affect mostly the isomerization step, having little, if any, effect on the ligand-affinity ratio.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels are allosteric membrane proteins that isomerize between C(losed) and O(pen) conformations. A difference in affinity for ligands in the two states influences the C↔O “gating” equilibrium constant. The energies associated with adult-type mouse neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel gating have been measured by using single-channel electrophysiology. Without ligands, the free energy, enthalpy and entropy of gating are $\Delta$G0=+8.4, $\Delta$H0=+10.9 and T$\Delta$S0=+2.5kcal/mol (−100mV, 23°C). Many mutations throughout the protein change $\Delta$G0, including natural ones that cause disease. Agonists and most mutations change approximately independently the ground-state energy difference; thus, it is possible to forecast and engineer AChR responses simply by combining perturbations. The free energy of the low↔high affinity change for the neurotransmitter at each of two functionally equivalent binding sites is $\Delta$GBACh=−5.1kcal/mol. $\Delta$GBACh is set mainly by interactions of ACh with just three binding site aromatic groups. For a series of structurally related agonists, there is a correlation between the energies of low- and high-affinity binding, which implies that gating commences with the formation of the low-affinity complex. Brief, intermediate states in binding and gating have been detected. Several proposals for the nature of the gating transition-state energy landscape and the isomerization mechanism are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) can quantitate antigen-specific T cell responses in settings such as experimental vaccination. Standardization of ICS among laboratories performing vaccine studies would provide a common platform by which to compare the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates across multiple international organizations conducting clinical trials. As such, a study was carried out among several laboratories involved in HIV clinical trials, to define the inter-lab precision of ICS using various sample types, and using a common protocol for each experiment (see additional files online). Three sample types (activated, fixed, and frozen whole blood; fresh whole blood; and cryopreserved PBMC) were shipped to various sites, where ICS assays using cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 peptide mix or control antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well plates. For one experiment, antigens and antibody cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to simplify and standardize the assay setup. Results (CD4+cytokine+ cells and CD8+cytokine+ cells) were determined by each site. Raw data were also sent to a central site for batch analysis with a dynamic gating template. Mean inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (C.V.) ranged from 17–44{\%} depending upon the sample type and analysis method. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded lower inter-lab C.V.'s than whole blood. Centralized analysis (using a dynamic gating template) reduced the inter-lab C.V. by 5–20{\%}, depending upon the experiment. The inter-lab C.V. was lowest (18–24{\%}) for samples with a mean of {\textgreater}0.5{\%} IFN$\gamma$ + T cells, and highest (57–82{\%}) for samples with a mean of {\textless}0.1{\%} IFN$\gamma$ + cells. ICS assays can be performed by multiple laboratories using a common protocol with good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as the frequency of responding cells increases. Cryopreserved PBMC may yield slightly more consistent results than shipped whole blood. Analysis, particularly gating, is a significant source of variability, and can be reduced by centralized analysis and/or use of a standardized dynamic gating template. Use of pre-aliquoted lyophilized reagents for stimulation and staining can provide further standardization to these assays.},

Mutations of the gene encoding -synuclein have been associated with familial variants of Parkinsons disease and lead to early- and late-onset forms of the disease. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches specifically designed for the study of -synuclein, we report that the mutations dramatically affect the rate of lipid-induced fibril production and surface-catalyzed fibril amplification processes. Such a systematic study provides new insights into the influence that single-amino acid replacements in -synuclein can have on the two steps of -synuclein aggregation that are likely to be crucial for disease: the initial formation of aggregates and their proliferation. Parkinsons disease is a highly debilitating neurodegenerative condition whose pathological hallmark is the presence in nerve cells of proteinacious deposits, known as Lewy bodies, composed primarily of amyloid fibrils of -synuclein. Several missense mutations in the gene encoding -synuclein have been associated with familial variants of Parkinsons disease and have been shown to affect the kinetics of the aggregation of the protein. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we present a systematic in vitro study of the influence of disease-associated single-point mutations on the individual processes involved in -synuclein aggregation into amyloid fibrils. We find that lipid-induced fibril production and surface catalyzed fibril amplification are the processes most strongly affected by these mutations and show that familial mutations can induce dramatic changes in the crucial processes thought to be associated with the initiation and spreading of the aggregation of -synuclein.},

abstract = {A highly conserved leucine is found in the middle of the porelining (M2) domain of the members of the ligand-gated ion channel family. Two very different roles have been proposed for this leucine. In one model, this residue swings into the lumen of the channel during desensitization to form the nonconducting desensitized state, whereas in the other model, the leucines from each subunit interact with each other to form a constriction in the channel that constitutes the actual gate of the channel. We examined the role of this leucine in the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor by replacing it with the polar amino acid threonine. Replacement of the leucine in any one subunit slows desensitization and shifts the dose-response relationship toward lower concentrations. Replacement of leucines in additional subunits leads to progressively larger shifts in the dose-response curves. The shift depends only on the number of leucines replaced, not on which particular subunits contain the mutation; in other words, the mutations act independently. At the single-channel level, the mutation greatly increases the channel mean open time. We conclude that the role of the conserved leucine is to set the mean open time of the channel through interactions with other regions of the receptor rather than to serve as the gate per se of the ion channel.},

These two structures in conjunction with in silico docking experiments provide snapshots of critical events in the function of the enzyme. The ordered substrate binding, observed experimentally, can now be structurally explained by a conformational change induced upon the binding of carbamoyl phosphate. This induced fit dramatically alters the electrostatics of the active site, creating a binding pocket for aspartate. Upon aspartate binding, a further change in electrostatics causes a second induced fit, the domain closure. This domain closure acts as a clamp that both facilitates catalysis by approximation and also initiates the global conformational change that manifests homotropic cooperativity.},

The enzyme was absolutely dependent on AMP for activity and showed sigmoidal activation curves with respect to isocitrate concentration. ATP was shown to be a potent inhibitor even in the presence of saturating AMP and isocitrate concentrations. NADH was the most potent inhibitor, followed by L-glutamate and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, and less strongly by citrate and oxaloacetate. The inhibition by L-glutamate and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate was noncompetitive, with respect to isocitrate, and indicated that the enzyme could be very susceptible to regulation by the products of organic nitrogen metabolism in this yeast.

In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},

Binding of cyclic nucleotide to a site in the intracellular carboxyl terminus of each subunit leads to channel activation. Since there are four subunits, four binding events are possible. In this study, we investigate the effects of individual binding events on activation by studying channels containing one, two, three, or four functional binding sites. The binding of a single ligand significantly increases opening, although four ligands are required for full activation. The data are inconsistent with models in which the four subunits activate in a single concerted step (Monod-Wyman-Changeux model) or in four independent steps (Hodgkin-Huxley model). Instead, the four subunits may associate and activate as two independent dimers.},

abstract = {The pathway of product release from the R state of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2.1.3.2, aspartate carbamoyltransferase) has been determined here by solving the crystal structure of Escherichia coli ATCase locked in the R quaternary structure by specific introduction of disulfide bonds. ATCase displays ordered substrate binding and product release, remaining in the R state until substrates are exhausted. The structure reported here represents ATCase in the R state bound to the final product molecule, phosphate. This structure has been difficult to obtain previously because the enzyme relaxes back to the T state after the substrates are exhausted. Hence, cocrystallizing the wild-type enzyme with phosphate results in a T-state structure. In this structure of the enzyme trapped in the R state with specific disulfide bonds, we observe two phosphate molecules per active site. The position of the first phosphate corresponds to the position of the phosphate of carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and the position of the phosphonate of N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate. However, the second, more weakly bound phosphate is bound in a positively charged pocket that is more accessible to the surface than the other phosphate. The second phosphate appears to be on the path that phosphate would have to take to exit the active site. Our results suggest that phosphate dissociation and CP binding can occur simultaneously and that the dissociation of phosphate may actually promote the binding of CP for more efficient catalysis.},

With increasing regularity, the transcriptional outputs from different promoters are being measured in quantitative detail in single-cell experiments thus providing the impetus for the development of quantitative models of transcription. We describe recent progress in developing models of transcriptional regulation that incorporate, to different degrees, the complexity of multi-state promoter dynamics, and its effect on the transcriptional outputs of single cells. The goal of these models is to predict the statistical properties of transcriptional outputs and characterize their variability in time and across a population of cells, as a function of the input concentrations of transcription factors. The interplay between mathematical models of different regulatory mechanisms and quantitative biophysical experiments holds the promise of elucidating the molecular-scale mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in cells, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and colonization of E. coli using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Biological systems produce outputs in response to variable inputs. Input-output relations tend to follow a few regular patterns. For example, many chemical processes follow the S-shaped Hill equation relation between input concentrations and output concentrations. That Hill equation pattern contradicts the fundamental Michaelis-Menten theory of enzyme kinetics. I use the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those components combine to determine the system's overall input-output relations. That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology. Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours. Natural selection may act primarily to modulate system properties within those broad constraints.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Eugene Koonin, Georg Luebeck and Sergei Maslov.},

Substrate inhibition is often regarded as a biochemical oddity and experimental annoyance. We show, using several case studies, that substrate inhibition often has important biological functions. In each case we discuss, the biological significance is different. Substrate inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase results in a steady synthesis of dopamine despite large fluctuations in tyrosine due to meals. Substrate inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enhances the neural signal and allows rapid signal termination. Substrate inhibition of phosphofructokinase ensures that resources are not devoted to manufacturing ATP when it is plentiful. In folate metabolism, substrate inhibition maintains reactions rates in the face of substantial folate deprivation. Substrate inhibition of DNA methyltransferase serves to faithfully copy DNA methylation patterns when cells divide while preventing de novo methylation of methyl-free promoter regions.},

The lac operon is a paradigm for understanding how metabolites function as signaling molecules and modulate transcription. These metabolites or allosteric effector molecules bind to the repressor and alter the conformational equilibrium between the induced and the repressed states. Here, we describe a set of experiments where we modified a single inducer binding site in a dimeric repressor and examined its effect on induction. Based upon these observations, we have been able to calculate the thermodynamic parameters that are responsible for the allosteric properties that govern repressor function.

abstract = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is a mechanism by which an event in one place of a protein structure causes an effect at another site, much like the behavior of a telecommunications network in which a collection of transmitters, receivers and transceivers communicate with each other across long distances. For example, ligand binding or an amino acid mutation at an allosteric site can alter enzymatic activity or binding affinity in a distal region such as the active site or a second binding site. The mechanism of this site-to-site communication is of great interest, especially since allosteric effects must be considered in drug design and protein engineering. In this review, conformational mobility as the common route between allosteric regulation and catalysis is discussed. We summarize recent experimental data and the resulting insights into allostery within proteins, and we discuss the nature of future studies and the new applications that may result from increased understanding of this regulatory mechanism.},

abstract = {Protein-protein bond formations, such as antibody-antigen complexation or aggregation of protein monomers into dimers and larger aggregates, occur with bimolecular rate constants on the order of 10(6) M-1.s-1, which is only 3 orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion-limited Smoluchowski rate. However, since the protein-protein bond requires rotational alignment to within a few angstroms of tolerance, purely geometric estimates would suggest that the observed rates might be 6 orders of magnitude below the Smoluchowski rate. Previous theoretical treatments have not been solved for the highly specific docking criteria of protein-protein association--the entire subunit interface must be aligned within 2 A of the correct position. Several studies have suggested that diffusion alone could not produce the rapid association kinetics and have postulated "lengthy collisions" and/or the operation of electrostatic or hydrophobic steering forces to accelerate the association. In the present study, the Brownian dynamics simulation method is used to compute the rate of association of neutral spherical model proteins with the stated docking criteria. The Brownian simulation predicts a rate of 2 x 10(6) M-1.s-1 for this generic protein-protein association, a rate that is 2000 times faster than that predicted by the simplest geometric calculation and is essentially equal to the rates observed for protein-protein association in aqueous solution. This high rate is obtained by simple diffusive processes and does not require any attractive or steering forces beyond those achieved for a partially formed bond. The rate enhancement is attributed to a diffusive entrapment effect, in which a protein pair surrounded and trapped by water undergoes multiple collisions with rotational reorientation during each encounter.},

abstract = {For nearly 60 years, the ATP activation and the CTP inhibition of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) has been the textbook example of allosteric regulation. We present kinetic data and five X-ray structures determined in the absence and presence of a Mg(2+) concentration within the physiological range. In the presence of 2 mM divalent cations (Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+)), CTP does not significantly inhibit the enzyme, while the allosteric activation by ATP is enhanced. The data suggest that the actual allosteric inhibitor of ATCase in vivo is the combination of CTP, UTP, and a divalent cation, and the actual allosteric activator is a divalent cation with ATP or ATP and GTP. The structural data reveals that two NTPs can bind to each allosteric site with a divalent cation acting as a bridge between the triphosphates. Thus, the regulation of ATCase is far more complex than previously believed and calls many previous studies into question. The X-ray structures reveal that the catalytic chains undergo essentially no alternations; however, several regions of the regulatory chains undergo significant structural changes. Most significant is that the N-terminal region of the regulatory chains exists in different conformations in the allosterically activated and inhibited forms of the enzyme. Here, a new model of allosteric regulation is proposed.},

abstract = {SignificanceActivation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by agonists is the first step of eukaryotic cellular signal transduction. Because GPCRs are expressed in almost all human tissues and play a key role in human physiology, they are the targets for more than 30{\%} of pharmaceutical drugs. Binding of ligands on the extracellular surface of a GPCR induces a conformational change on the cytoplasmic surface, which is recognized by G proteins or other cellular effectors. Here we show that the {\{}beta{\}}2-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, naturally fluctuates between inactive and active conformations, and that agonist or inverse agonist ligands modulate the conformational exchange kinetics in distinct ways, explaining their different pharmacological efficacies. These insights should assist in the design of improved GPCR-targeting drugs. Binding of extracellular ligands to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiates transmembrane signaling by inducing conformational changes on the cytoplasmic receptor surface. Knowledge of this process provides a platform for the development of GPCR-targeting drugs. Here, using a site-specific Cy3 fluorescence probe in the human {\{}beta{\}}2-adrenergic receptor ({\{}beta{\}}2AR), we observed that individual receptor molecules in the native-like environment of phospholipid nanodiscs undergo spontaneous transitions between two distinct conformational states. These states are assigned to inactive and active-like receptor conformations. Individual receptor molecules in the apo form repeatedly sample both conformations, with a bias toward the inactive conformation. Experiments in the presence of drug ligands show that binding of the full agonist formoterol shifts the conformational distribution in favor of the active-like conformation, whereas binding of the inverse agonist ICI-118,551 favors the inactive conformation. Analysis of single-molecule dwell-time distributions for each state reveals that formoterol increases the frequency of activation transitions, while also reducing the frequency of deactivation events. In contrast, the inverse agonist increases the frequency of deactivation transitions. Our observations account for the high level of basal activity of this receptor and provide insights that help to rationalize, on the molecular level, the widely documented variability of the pharmacological efficacies among GPCR-targeting drugs.},

abstract = {Hub proteins are proteins that maintain promiscuous molecular recognition. Because they are reported to play essential roles in cellular control, there has been a special interest in the study of their structural and functional properties, yet the mechanisms by which they evolve to maintain functional interactions are poorly understood. By combining biophysical simulations of coarse-grained proteins and analysis of proteins-complex crystallographic structures, we seek to elucidate those mechanisms. We focus on two types of hub proteins: Multi hubs, which interact with their partners through different interfaces, and Singlish hubs, which do so through a single interface. We show that loss of structural stability is required for the evolution of protein-protein-interaction (PPI) networks, and it is more profound in Singlish hub systems. In addition, different ratios of hydrophobic to electrostatic interfacial amino acids are shown to support distinct network topologies (i.e., Singlish and Multi systems), and therefore underlie a fundamental design principle of PPI in a crowded environment. We argue that the physical nature of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in particular, their favoring of either same-type interactions (hydrophobic-hydrophobic), or opposite-type interactions (negatively-positively charged) plays a key role in maintaining the network topology while allowing the protein amino acid sequence to evolve.},

abstract = {The allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) exists in two conformational states. The enzyme, in the absence of substrates is primarily in the low-activity T state, is converted to the high-activity R state upon substrate binding, and remains in the R state until substrates are exhausted. These conformational changes have made it difficult to obtain structural data on R-state active-site complexes. Here we report the R-state structure of ATCase with the substrate Asp and the substrate analog phosphonoactamide (PAM) bound. This R-state structure represents the stage in the catalytic mechanism immediately before the formation of the covalent bond between the nitrogen of the amino group of Asp and the carbonyl carbon of carbamoyl phosphate. The binding mode of the PAM is similar to the binding mode of the phosphonate moiety of N-(phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA), the carboxylates of Asp interact with the same residues that interact with the carboxylates of PALA, although the position and orientations are shifted. The amino group of Asp is 2.9 A away from the carbonyl oxygen of PAM, positioned correctly for the nucleophilic attack. Arg105 and Leu267 in the catalytic chain interact with PAM and Asp and help to position the substrates correctly for catalysis. This structure fills a key gap in the structural determination of each of the steps in the catalytic cycle. By combining these data with previously determined structures we can now visualize the allosteric transition through detailed atomic motions that underlie the molecular mechanism.},

abstract = {Equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics have been used to reinvestigate the kinetic mechanism of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase) at pH 7.0, 30 °C. Keq = 5.9 (±0.6) × 103, allowing variation of substrate concentrations above and below their Km values in all experiments, a condition not possible at pH 7.8 [F. C. Wedler and F. J. Gasser (1974) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 163, 57–68]. The rate of the [14C]Asp ⇌ N-carbamoyl l-aspartate (CAsp) exchange reaction was five times faster than that of [32P]carbamyl phosphate (CP) ⇌ Pi, which argues strongly against the rapid equilibrium random mechanism previously proposed by E. Heyde, A. Nagabhushanam, and J. F. Morrison [Biochemistry 12, 4718–4726 (1973)]. Substrate concentrations were varied either as reactant-product pairs (holding the other pair constant) or together simultaneously in constant ratio at equilibrium. The resulting kinetic saturation patterns were most consistent with a preferred order random kinetic mechanism, with CP binding prior to Asp and with CAsp being released before Pi. Weak inhibition effects at high substrate levels could be accounted for by multiple weak dead-end complexes or ionic strength effects. Computer-based simulations have led to a set of rate constants that fit the experimental data, are in agreement with rate constants measured previously by pre-steady-state methods, and predict the correct initial velocities in the forward and reverse directions. Simulations also show that rate constants consistent with any of the various alternative mechanisms do not provide good fit to the experimental data. A model for the kinetic mechanism is considered, in which the binding of Asp prior to CP may restrict access of CP to the active site, but CP binding prior to Asp potentiates the enzyme for the allosteric (T-R) transition, centered entirely upon the Asp binding process.},

abstract = {Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

abstract = {Cellular physiology is implemented by formidably complex biochemical systems with highly nonlinear dynamics, presenting a challenge for both experiment and theory. Time-scale separation has been one of the few theoretical methods for distilling general principles from such complexity. It has provided essential insights in areas such as enzyme kinetics, allosteric enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, gene regulation and post-translational modification. In each case, internal molecular complexity has been eliminated, leading to rational algebraic expressions among the remaining components. This has yielded familiar formulas such as those of Michaelis-Menten in enzyme kinetics, Monod-Wyman-Changeux in allostery and Ackers-Johnson-Shea in gene regulation. Here we show that these calculations are all instances of a single graph-theoretic framework. Despite the biochemical nonlinearity to which it is applied, this framework is entirely linear, yet requires no approximation. We show that elimination of internal complexity is feasible when the relevant graph is strongly connected. The framework provides a new methodology with the potential to subdue combinatorial explosion at the molecular level.},

abstract = {Open- and closed-state lifetimes of unliganded acetylcholine receptor channel activity were analyzed by the method of likelihood maximazation. For both open times and closed times, the best-fitting density is most often a sum of two exponentials. These multiple open states cannot depend on the number of receptor binding sites occupied since they are observed in the absence of ligand. The rate of spontaneous opening and the faster decay constant of closing increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized. The voltage dependence of the rate of spontaneous opening is stronger than that for curare-liganded channels. Evidence that the acetylcholine receptor channel can open spontaneously in the absence of ligand has been presented previously (Sanchez et al, 1983; Brehm et al, 1984; Jackson, 1984). To add to this evidence, alpha-bungarotoxin was added to the patch electrode, causing the frequency of openings to decay with time. The rate constant determined from this decay is similar to rate constants reported for the binding of iodinated alpha-bungarotoxin to the acetylcholine receptor. The frequency of unliganded channel opening has been estimated as 2 X 10(-3) s-1 per receptor. A comparison of carbamylcholine-liganded and spontaneous gating transition rates suggests that ligand binding increases the rate of opening by a factor of 1.4 X 10(7). Carbamylcholine binding increases the mean open time by a factor of 5. Thus, a cholinergic agonist activates the acetylcholine receptor by destabilizing the closed state. The liganded and unliganded channel gating rates were used to analyze the energetics of ligand activation of the acetylcholine receptor channel, and to relate the open channel dissociation constant to the closed channel dissociation constant.},

The Hill coefficient is best thought of as an "interaction" coefficient, reflecting the extent of cooperativity among multiple ligand binding sites. Several relatively simple, physically plausible reaction schemes are shown here to produce a variety of ligand dose-response curve phenotypes more appropriately suited to modeling ligand-receptor interactions, especially if independent information about the stochiometry of the ligand-receptor interaction is available.},

Using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to flank the sickle mutation, we demonstrate efficient targeted cleavage at the $\beta$-globin locus with minimal off-target modification. By co-delivering a homologous donor template (either an integrase-defective lentiviral vector or a DNA oligonucleotide), high levels of gene modification were achieved in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Modified cells maintained their ability to engraft NOD/SCID/IL2r$\gamma$(null) mice and to produce cells from multiple lineages, although with a reduction in the modification levels relative to the in vitro samples. Importantly, ZFN-driven gene correction in CD34(+) cells from the bone marrow of patients with SCD resulted in the production of wild-type hemoglobin tetramers.},

Since then, spectacular advances in determining biological structure, manipulating genes, engineering proteins, sequencing whole genomes, and computing have led not just to an expansion of protein science, but to its utter transformation. We have entered a new era of protein design, sparked by the convergence of protein folding and enzymology. Fersht's Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science is a defining exploration of this new era, an expert depiction of the core principles of protein structure, activity, and mechanism as understood and applied today. A thorough recasting of Fersht's previous text, the book takes a more general look at mechanisms in protein science, emphasizing the unity of concepts in folding and catalysis and the importance of the relationships between basic chemistry, kinetics, thermodynamics, and structure. By concentrating on fundamental principles and the physical and chemical processes behind them, Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science makes the basic formulas, kinetics, and thermodynamics of protein engineering easier to understand and apply. Up-to-date, authoritative, and full with relevant examples, it provides a solid introduction to a sprawling, still-growing field.},

Activation of the enzyme by the purine nucleotide ATP may also have regulatory significance. ATCase and threonine deaminase of E. coli were the first enzymes to be characterized with regard to their allosteric properties, namely, sigmoidal saturation with regard to substrates, reflecting cooperative ligand binding at the active site, and inhibition and activation by nucleotides of very different chemical structure from the substrates. In the case of ATCase, the nucleotides bind at regulatory sites located on protein subunits different from those bearing the active sites. The early characterization of ATCase proved useful in the 1965 conceptualization of the allosteric transition by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux [Monod J et al. (1965) J Mol Biol 12, 88-118], and the protein in subsequent years has proved useful in the experimental analysis of the interactions of sites and of conformational changes in allosteric proteins. This is an account of the early years of work on ATCase, up to 1965.},

Studying the composition and ecology of bacterial ecosystems and understanding their function is of prime importance. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable nearly comprehensive descriptions of bacterial diversity through 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Analyses of these communities generally rely upon taxonomic assignments through reference databases, or clustering approaches using de facto sequence similarity thresholds to identify operational taxonomic units. However, these methods often fail to resolve ecologically meaningful differences between closely related organisms in complex microbial datasets.In this paper we describe oligotyping, a novel supervised computational method that allows researchers to investigate the diversity of closely related but distinct bacterial organisms in final operational taxonomic units identified in environmental datasets through 16S ribosomal RNA gene data by the canonical approaches.Our analysis of two datasets from two distinct environments demonstrates the capacity of oligotyping at discriminating distinct microbial populations of ecological importance.Oligotyping can resolve the distribution of closely related organisms across environments and unveil previously overlooked ecological patterns for microbial communities.

Occupation of the binding sites by agonist molecules transiently increases the probability that the channel is ion-permeable. Recent experiments show that the Monod, Wyman and Changeux formalism for allosteric proteins, originally developed for haemoglobin, is an excellent model for acetylcholine receptors. By using mutations and single-channel electrophysiology, the gating equilibrium constants for receptors with zero, one or two bound agonist molecules, and the agonist association and dissociation rate constants from both the closed- and open-channel conformations, have been estimated experimentally. The change in affinity for each transmitter molecule between closed and open conformations provides {\~{}}-5.1 kcal mol(-1) towards the global gating isomerization of the protein.},

abstract = {Yeast NAD(+)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase is an allosterically regulated octameric enzyme composed of four heterodimers of a catalytic IDH2 subunit and a regulatory IDH1 subunit. Despite structural predictions that the enzyme would contain eight isocitrate binding sites, four NAD(+) binding sites, and four AMP binding sites, only half of the sites for each ligand can be measured in binding assays. On the basis of a potential interaction between side chains of Cys-150 residues in IDH2 subunits in each tetramer of the enzyme, ligand binding assays of wild-type (IDH1/IDH2) and IDH1/IDH2(C150S) octameric enzymes were conducted in the presence of dithiothreitol. These assays demonstrated the presence of eight isocitrate and four AMP binding sites for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of dithiothreitol and for the IDH1/IDH2(C150S) enzyme in the absence or presence of this reagent, suggesting that interactions between sulfhydryl side chains of IDH2 Cys-150 residues limit access to these sites. However, only two NAD(+) sites could be measured for either enzyme. A tetrameric form of IDH (an IDH1(G15D)/IDH2 mutant enzyme) demonstrated half-site binding for isocitrate (two sites) in the absence of dithiothreitol and full-site binding (four sites) in the presence of dithiothreitol. Only one NAD(+) site could be measured for the tetramer under both conditions. In the context of the structure of the enzyme, these results suggest that an observed asymmetry between heterotetramers in the holoenzyme contributes to interactions between IDH2 Cys-150 residues and to half-site binding of isocitrate, but that a form of negative cooperativity may limit access to apparently equivalent NAD(+) binding sites.},

abstract = {The activity of many proteins, including metabolic enzymes, molecular machines, and ion channels, is often regulated by conformational changes that are induced or stabilized by ligand binding. In cases of multimeric proteins, such allosteric regulation has often been described by the concerted Monod-Wyman-Changeux and sequential Koshland-N{\'{e}}methy-Filmer classic models of cooperativity. Despite the important functional implications of the mechanism of cooperativity, it has been impossible in many cases to distinguish between these various allosteric models using ensemble measurements of ligand binding in bulk protein solutions. Here, we demonstrate that structural MS offers a way to break this impasse by providing the full distribution of ligand-bound states of a protein complex. Given this distribution, it is possible to determine all the binding constants of a ligand to a highly multimeric cooperative system, and thereby infer its allosteric mechanism. Our approach to the dissection of allosteric mechanisms relies on advances in MS--which provide the required resolution of ligand-bound states--and in data analysis. We validated our approach using the well-characterized Escherichia coli chaperone GroEL, a double-heptameric ring containing 14 ATP binding sites, which has become a paradigm for molecular machines. The values of the 14 binding constants of ATP to GroEL were determined, and the ATP-loading pathway of the chaperone was characterized. The methodology and analyses presented here are directly applicable to numerous other cooperative systems and are therefore expected to promote further research on allosteric systems.},

abstract = {Efforts in whole-genome sequencing and structural proteomics start to provide a global view of the protein universe, the set of existing protein structures and sequences. However, approaches based on the selection of individual sequences have not been entirely successful at the quantitative description of the distribution of structures and sequences in the protein universe because evolutionary pressure acts on the entire organism, rather than on a particular molecule. In parallel to this line of study, studies in population genetics and phenomenological molecular evolution established a mathematical framework to describe the changes in genome sequences in populations of organisms over time. Here, we review both microscopic (physics-based) and macroscopic (organism-level) models of protein-sequence evolution and demonstrate that bridging the two scales provides the most complete description of the protein universe starting from clearly defined, testable, and physiologically relevant assumptions.},

@article{Edelstein1996,
abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are transmembrane oligomeric proteins that mediate interconversions between open and closed channel states under the control of neurotransmitters. Fast in vitro chemical kinetics and in vivo electrophysiological recordings are consistent with the following multi-step scheme. Upon binding of agonists, receptor molecules in the closed but activatable resting state (the Basal state, B) undergo rapid transitions to states of higher affinities with either open channels (the Active state, A) or closed channels (the initial Inactivatable and fully Desensitized states, I and D). In order to represent the functional properties of such receptors, we have developed a kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the position of the interconversion transition states on a hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the model to the peripheral nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including single-channel events, and several new relationships are predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced previously. According to the model, recovery from the desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the standard 'cycle' model. Transitions to the desensitized states by low concentration 'pre-pulses' are predicted to occur without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times. Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and their possible role in coincidence detection. In terms of future developments, the analysis presented here provides a physical basis for constructing more biologically realistic models of synaptic modulation that may be applied to artificial neural networks.},

abstract = {The chemotaxis system in the bacterium Escherichia coli is remarkably sensitive to small relative changes in the concentrations of multiple chemical signals over a broad range of ambient concentrations. Interactions among receptors are crucial to this sensitivity as is precise adaptation, the return of chemoreceptor activity to prestimulus levels in a constant chemoeffector environment. Precise adaptation relies on methylation and demethylation of chemoreceptors by the enzymes CheR and CheB, respectively. Experiments indicate that when transiently bound to one receptor, these enzymes act on small assistance neighborhoods (AN) of five to seven receptor homodimers. In this paper, we model a strongly coupled complex of receptors including dynamic CheR and CheB acting on ANs. The model yields sensitive response and precise adaptation over several orders of magnitude of attractant concentrations and accounts for different responses to aspartate and serine. Within the model, we explore how the precision of adaptation is limited by small AN size as well as by CheR and CheB kinetics (including dwell times, saturation, and kinetic differences among modification sites) and how these kinetics contribute to noise in complex activity. The robustness of our dynamic model for precise adaptation is demonstrated by randomly varying biochemical parameters.},

@article{Mirzaev2013,
abstract = {In previous work, we have introduced a "linear framework" for time-scale separation in biochemical systems, which is based on a labelled, directed graph, G, and an associated linear differential equation, dx/dt = L(G) ∙ x, where L(G) is the Laplacian matrix of G. Biochemical nonlinearity is encoded in the graph labels. Many central results in molecular biology can be systematically derived within this framework, including those for enzyme kinetics, allosteric proteins, G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, gene regulation at thermodynamic equilibrium, and protein post-translational modification. In the present paper, in response to new applications, which accommodate nonequilibrium mechanisms in eukaryotic gene regulation, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the framework. We show that, for any graph and any initial condition, the dynamics always reaches a steady state, which can be algorithmically calculated. If the graph is not strongly connected, which may occur in gene regulation, we show that the dynamics can exhibit flexible behavior that resembles multistability. We further reveal an unexpected equivalence between deterministic Laplacian dynamics and the master equations of continuous-time Markov processes, which allows rigorous treatment within the framework of stochastic, single-molecule mechanisms.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial NAD(+)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are key regulators of flux through biosynthetic and oxidative pathways in response to cellular energy levels. Here we present the first structures of a eukaryotic member of this enzyme family, the allosteric, hetero-octameric, NAD(+)-specific IDH from yeast in three forms: 1) without ligands, 2) with bound analog citrate, and 3) with bound citrate + AMP. The structures reveal the molecular basis for ligand binding to homologous but distinct regulatory and catalytic sites positioned at the interfaces between IDH1 and IDH2 subunits and define pathways of communication between heterodimers and heterotetramers in the hetero-octamer. Disulfide bonds observed at the heterotetrameric interfaces in the unliganded IDH hetero-octamer are reduced in the ligand-bound forms, suggesting a redox regulatory mechanism that may be analogous to the "on-off" regulation of non-allosteric bacterial IDHs via phosphorylation. The results strongly suggest that eukaryotic IDH enzymes are exquisitely tuned to ensure that allosteric activation occurs only when concentrations of isocitrate are elevated.},

abstract = {DNA is subject to large deformations in a wide range of biological processes. Two key examples illustrate how such deformations influence the readout of the genetic information: the sequestering of eukaryotic genes by nucleosomes and DNA looping in transcriptional regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These kinds of regulatory problems are now becoming amenable to systematic quantitative dissection with a powerful dialogue between theory and experiment. Here, we use a single-molecule experiment in conjunction with a statistical mechanical model to test quantitative predictions for the behavior of DNA looping at short length scales and to determine how DNA sequence affects looping at these lengths. We calculate and measure how such looping depends upon four key biological parameters: the strength of the transcription factor binding sites, the concentration of the transcription factor, and the length and sequence of the DNA loop. Our studies lead to the surprising insight that sequences that are thought to be especially favorable for nucleosome formation because of high flexibility lead to no systematically detectable effect of sequence on looping, and begin to provide a picture of the distinctions between the short length scale mechanics of nucleosome formation and looping.},

Understanding of these global effects is necessary for??a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence). ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A missense mutation that alters the protein binding affinity may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of the function, potentially leading to diseases. The availability of computational methods to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein-protein binding is critical for a wide range of biomedical applications. Here, we report an efficient computational approach for predicting the effect of single and multiple missense mutations on protein-protein binding affinity. It is based on a well-tested simulation protocol for structure minimization, modified MM-PBSA and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousands of mutations. Our simulation protocol yields very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.63 and root-mean-square errors of 1.20 and 1.90 kcal mol(-1) for single and multiple mutations, respectively. Compared with other available methods, our approach achieves high speed and prediction accuracy and can be applied to large datasets generated by modern genomics initiatives. In addition, we report a crucial role of water model and the polar solvation energy in estimating the changes in binding affinity. Our analysis also reveals that prediction accuracy and effect of mutations on binding strongly depends on the type of mutation and its location in a protein complex.},

Regulation by small-molecule, allosteric interactions is an exception.

abstract = {Regulation of protein function, often achieved by allosteric mechanisms, is central to normal physiology and cellular processes. Although numerous models have been proposed to account for the cooperative binding of ligands to allosteric proteins and enzymes, direct structural support has been lacking. Here, we used a combination of X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering in solution to provide direct structural evidence that the binding of ligand to just one of the six active sites of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase induces a concerted structural transition from the T to the R state.},

abstract = {The cell represents a highly organized state of living matter, in which numerous geometrical parameters are under dynamic regulation in order to match the form of a cell with its function. Cells appear capable of regulating not only the total quantity of their internal organelles but also the size and number of those organelles. The regulation of three parameters—size, number, and total quantity—can, in principle, be accomplished by regulating the production or growth of organelles, their degradation or disassembly, and their partitioning among daughter cells during division. Any or all of these steps could, in principle, be under regulation. But whether organelle assembly or disassembly is regulated by number or size raises interesting questions about how the cell would recognize how many copies of an organelle it has or how big they are.

abstract = {Models for subunit interactions are examined by means of interpreting ligand saturation curves. Equations are derived to indicate the effect of variables such as the strength of binding of the ligand, the geo- metrical arrangement of subunits, the strength of inter- action between subunits, the energy of the conforma- tion change, and the effect of nonidentical subunits. Rapid methods, i.e., equations and nomograms, are developed to fit theoretical curves to experimental data with a minimum of parameters. Applying these pro- cedures to the binding of oxygen by hemoglobin as an illustrative example, it is seen that a number of simple models can represent the published data accurately. In general it appears that unique mechanisms cannot be established from ligand saturation curves by them- selves, but the mathematical analysis of the curves indi- cates possible sources of additional information to make such distinctions possible.},

abstract = {A statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to account for the cooperative interactions of the bacteriophage lambda repressor with the lambda right operator. The model incorporates a general theory for quantitatively interpreting cooperative site-specific equilibrium binding data. Values for all interaction parameters of the model have been evaluated at 37 degrees C, 0.2 M KCl, from results of DNase protection experiments in vitro [A. D. Johnson, B. J. Meyer, {\&} M. Ptashne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 76, 5061-5065]. With these values, the model predicts repression curves at the divergent promoters PR and PRM that control transcription of genes coding for the regulatory proteins cro and repressor, respectively. At physiological repressor concentrations, repression at PR is predicted to be nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain highly active. The results demonstrate the importance of cooperative interactions between repressor dimers bound to the adjacent operator sites OR1 and OR2 in maintaining a stable lysogenic state and in allowing efficient switchover to the lytic state during induction.},

abstract = {Ever since the integration of Mendelian genetics into evolutionary biology in the early 20th century, evolutionary geneticists have for the most part treated genes and mutations as generic entities. However, recent observations indicate that all genes are not equal in the eyes of evolution. Evolutionarily relevant mutations tend to accumulate in hotspot genes and at specific positions within genes. Genetic evolution is constrained by gene function, the structure of genetic networks, and population biology. The genetic basis of evolution may be predictable to some extent, and further understanding of this predictability requires incorporation of the specific functions and characteristics of genes into evolutionary theory.},

abstract = {A critical early step in drug discovery is the screening of a chemical library. Typically, promising compounds are identified in a primary screen and then more fully characterized in a dose-response analysis with 7-10 data points per compound. Here, we describe a robust microfluidic approach that increases the number of data points to approximately 10,000 per compound. The system exploits Taylor-Aris dispersion to create concentration gradients, which are then segmented into picoliter microreactors by droplet-based microfluidics. The large number of data points results in IC(50) values that are highly precise (± 2.40{\%} at 95{\%} confidence) and highly reproducible (CV = 2.45{\%}, n = 16). In addition, the high resolution of the data reveals complex dose-response relationships unambiguously. We used this system to screen a chemical library of 704 compounds against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a diabetes, obesity, and cancer target. We identified a number of novel inhibitors, the most potent being sodium cefsulodine, which has an IC(50) of 27 ± 0.83 $\mu$M.},

abstract = {Substrate inhibition is considered a defining property of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whereas substrate activation is characteristic of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). To understand the mechanism of substrate inhibition, the pH dependence of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis by AChE was studied between pH 5 and 8. Wild-type human AChE and its mutants Y337G and Y337W, as well as wild-type Bungarus fasciatus AChE and its mutants Y333G, Y333A and Y333W were studied. The pH profile results were unexpected. Instead of substrate inhibition, wild-type AChE and all mutants showed substrate activation at low pH. At high pH, there was substrate inhibition for wild-type AChE and for the mutant with tryptophan in the $\pi$-cation subsite, but substrate activation for mutants containing small residues, glycine or alanine. This is particularly apparent in the B. fasciatus AChE. Thus a single amino acid substitution in the $\pi$-cation site, from the aromatic tyrosine of B. fasciatus AChE to the alanine of BuChE, caused AChE to behave like BuChE. Excess substrate binds to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The finding that AChE is activated by excess substrate supports the idea that binding of a second substrate molecule to the PAS induces a conformational change that reorganizes the active site.},

abstract = {A central goal of synthetic biology is to design sophisticated synthetic cellular circuits that can perform complex computations and information processing tasks in response to specific inputs. The tremendous advances in our ability to understand and manipulate cellular information processing networks raises several fundamental physics questions: How do the molecular components of cellu-lar circuits exploit energy consumption to improve information processing? Can one utilize ideas from thermodynamics to improve the design of synthetic cellular circuits and modules? Here, we summarize recent theoretical work addressing these questions. Energy consumption in cellular cir-cuits serves five basic purposes: (1) increasing specificity, (2) manipulating dynamics, (3) reducing variability, (4) amplifying signal, and (5) erasing memory. We demonstrate these ideas using several simple examples and discuss the implications of these theoretical ideas for the emerging field of synthetic biology. We conclude by discussing how it may be possible to overcome these limitations using " post-translational " synthetic biology that exploits reversible protein modification. Cells live in complex and dynamic environments. They sense and respond to both external environmental cues and to each other through cell-to-cell communication. Adapting to changing environments often requires cells to perform complex information processing, and cells have developed elaborate signaling networks to accomplish this feat. These biochemical networks are ubiquitous in biology, ranging from the quorum-sensing 1 and chemo-taxis networks 2 in single-celled organisms to develop-mental networks in higher organisms 3 . Inspired by both these natural circuits and physical computing devices, synthetic biologists are designing sophisticated synthetic circuits that can perform complicated " computing-like " behaviors. Synthetic biologists have designed gene cir-cuits executing a wide range of functionalities includ-ing switches 4 , oscillators 5 , counters 6 , and even cell-to-cell communicators 7 . Despite these successes, many challenges to harnessing the full potential of synthetic biology persist 8–15 . While there are guiding principles to synthetic biology 16 , ac-tual construction of synthetic circuits often proceeds in an ad-hoc manner through a mixture of biological intu-ition and trial-and-error. Furthermore, the functional-ity and applicability is limited by a dearth of biological components 17 . For this reason, it would be helpful to identify general principles that can improve the design of synthetic circuits and help guide the search for new bio-logical parts. One promising direction along these lines is recent work examining the relationship between the information processing capabilities of these biochemical networks and their energetic costs (technically this is usu-ally a cost in free energy, but for the sake of brevity we will refer to this as energy). Energetic costs place im-portant constraints on the design of physical computing devices 18 as well as on neural computing architectures in the brain and retina 19 , suggesting that thermodynamics},

Here, we characterize the fitness landscape of the six amino acids controlling coenzyme use in isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IMDH). Although all natural IMDHs use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a coenzyme, they can be engineered to use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) instead. Intermediates between these two phenotypic extremes show that each amino acid contributes additively to enzyme function, with epistatic contributions confined to fitness. The genotype-phenotype-fitness map shows that NAD use is a global optimum.},

abstract = {Severe intellectual disability (ID) occurs in 0.5{\%} of newborns and is thought to be largely genetic in origin. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of this disorder requires a genome-wide detection of all types of genetic variation. Microarray studies and, more recently, exome sequencing have demonstrated the importance of de novo copy number variations (CNVs) and single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in ID, but the majority of cases remain undiagnosed. Here we applied whole-genome sequencing to 50 patients with severe ID and their unaffected parents. All patients included had not received a molecular diagnosis after extensive genetic prescreening, including microarray-based CNV studies and exome sequencing. Notwithstanding this prescreening, 84 de novo SNVs affecting the coding region were identified, which showed a statistically significant enrichment of loss-of-function mutations as well as an enrichment for genes previously implicated in ID-related disorders. In addition, we identified eight de novo CNVs, including single-exon and intra-exonic deletions, as well as interchromosomal duplications. These CNVs affected known ID genes more frequently than expected. On the basis of diagnostic interpretation of all de novo variants, a conclusive genetic diagnosis was reached in 20 patients. Together with one compound heterozygous CNV causing disease in a recessive mode, this results in a diagnostic yield of 42{\%} in this extensively studied cohort, and 62{\%} as a cumulative estimate in an unselected cohort. These results suggest that de novo SNVs and CNVs affecting the coding region are a major cause of severe ID. Genome sequencing can be applied as a single genetic test to reliably identify and characterize the comprehensive spectrum of genetic variation, providing a genetic diagnosis in the majority of patients with severe ID.},

abstract = {The interaction between antipolysaccharide (anti-PS) antibodies and their antigens was investigated by the use of isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the thermodynamic binding constant (K), the change in the enthalpy of binding (DeltaH), and the binding density (N) to high-molecular-weight PSs. From these values, the change in the entropy of binding (DeltaS) was calculated. The thermodynamic parameters of binding to high-molecular-weight capsular PSs are reported for two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with different specificities for meningococcal serogroup C PS, five MAbs specific for different pneumococcal serotypes, and the Fab fragments of two antipneumococcal MAbs. The K values were in the range of 10(6) to 10(7) M(-1), and these values were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the previously reported K values derived from antibody-oligosaccharide interactions. The DeltaH associated with binding was favorable for each MAb and Fab fragment. The DeltaS associated with binding was also generally favorable for both the MAbs and the Fab fragments, with the exception of the anti-serotype 14 MAb and its Fab fragment. N provides information regarding how densely MAbs or Fabs can bind along PS chains and, as expressed in terms of monosaccharides, was very similar for the seven MAbs, with an average of 12 monosaccharides per bound MAb. The value of N for each Fab was smaller, with five or seven monosaccharides per bound Fab. These results suggest that steric interactions between antibody molecules are a major influence on the values of N of high-affinity MAbs to capsular PSs.},

It provides undergraduate and graduate students the conceptual tools needed to make sense of the dizzying array of pathways used by the cell to communicate. By emphasizing the common design principles, components, and logic that drives all signaling, the book develops a conceptual framework through which students can understand how thousands of diverse signaling proteins interact with each other in vast interconnected networks. The book first examines the common currencies of cellular information processing and the core components of the signaling machinery. It then shows how these individual components link together into networks and pathways to perform more sophisticated tasks. Many specific examples are provided throughout to illustrate common principles, and provide a comprehensive overview of major eukaryotic signaling pathways.},

We present a model for signal integration by mixed clusters of interacting two-state chemoreceptors. Our model results compare favorably to the results obtained by Sourjik and Berg with in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Importantly, we identify two distinct regimes of behavior, depending on the relative energies of the two states of the receptors. In regime I, coupling of receptors leads to high sensitivity, while in regime II, coupling of receptors leads to high cooperativity, i.e., high Hill coefficient. For homogeneous receptors, we predict an observable transition between regime I and regime II with increasing receptor methylation or amidation.},

abstract = {The synapse is a localized neurohumoral contact between a neuron and an effector cell and may be considered the quantum of fast intercellular communication. Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in understanding postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the motor endplate. The endplate AChR belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the AChR and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the ‘regulation factor'. This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

abstract = {Many cellular functions depend on highly specific intermolecular interactions, for example transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, microRNAs and their RNA binding sites, the interfaces between heterodimeric protein molecules, the stems in RNA molecules, and kinases and their response regulators in signal-transduction systems. Despite the need for complementarity between interacting partners, such pairwise systems seem to be capable of high levels of evolutionary divergence, even when subject to strong selection. Such behavior is a consequence of the diminishing advantages of increasing binding affinity between partners, the multiplicity of evolutionary pathways between selectively equivalent alternatives, and the stochastic nature of evolutionary processes. Because mutation pressure toward reduced affinity conflicts with selective pressure for greater interaction, situations can arise in which the expected distribution of the degree of matching between interacting partners is bimodal, even in the face of constant selection. Although biomolecules with larger numbers of interacting partners are subject to increased levels of evolutionary conservation, their more numerous partners need not converge on a single sequence motif or be increasingly constrained in more complex systems. These results suggest that most phylogenetic differences in the sequences of binding interfaces are not the result of adaptive fine tuning but a simple consequence of random genetic drift.},

@article{Gerhart1965,
abstract = {Kinetic investigations of regulatory enzymes have led to the current view that such enzymes bind their regulatory metabolites at sites distinct from the active sites, and that inhibition (or activation) requires the cooperative interaction of subunits within the enzyme molecules. This communication presents direct physicochemical studies concerning one such enzyme, aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), in terms of its subunit structure and binding of the specific inhibitory metabolite, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). As judged from sedimentation and viscosity studies, ATCase from Escherichia coli is a compact, globular protein with a sedimentation coefficient (s20) of 11.7 S, an intrinsic viscosity of 0.045 dl/g, and a molecular weight of 3.1*10{\^{}}5. Ultracentrifugal analysis of the binding of the CTP analog, 5-bromocytidine triphosphate (BrCTP), reveals the existence of eight receptor sites on the enzyme. Upon the addition of the mercurial, p-mercuribenzoate, native ATCase dissociates into two types of subunits which are easily separable by zone centrifugation or column chromatography. The larger, with s20=5.8 S and molecular weight of 9.6*10{\^{}}4, possesses the entire catalytic activity of the native enzyme and is completely insensitive to the inhibitor, CTP. This protein is termed the catalytic subunit. The second protein, with s20=2.8 S and molecular weight of 3*10{\^{}}4, is enzymically inactive and is unnecessary for the activity of the catalytic subunit. This smaller protein, termed the regulatory subunit, bears the receptor sites for the inhibitor, BrCTP, and is required for the control of enzymic activity. Since the regulatory subunits comprise 37{\%} of the total weight of the native enzyme, it can be calculated that there are four such subunits in each ATCase molecule. Similarly it can be concluded that the native enzyme contains two catalytic subunits. The native enzyme can be reconstituted from the unfractionated subunits upon removal of the p-mercuribenzoate through the addition of mercaptoethanol. Also, upon mixing of the separated subunits from which the mercurial had been removed, aggregation occurs spontaneously to produce a complex having the catalytic and regulatory properties of the native enzyme.},

abstract = {The existence of constitutive activity for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) was first described in 1980s. In 1991, the first naturally occurring constitutively active mutations in GPCRs that cause diseases were reported in rhodopsin. Since then, numerous constitutively active mutations that cause human diseases were reported in several additional receptors. More recently, loss of constitutive activity was postulated to also cause diseases. Animal models expressing some of these mutants confirmed the roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of the diseases. Detailed functional studies of these naturally occurring mutations, combined with homology modeling using rhodopsin crystal structure as the template, lead to important insights into the mechanism of activation in the absence of crystal structure of GPCRs in active state. Search for inverse agonists on these receptors will be critical for correcting the diseases cause by activating mutations in GPCRs. Theoretically, these inverse agonists are better therapeutics than neutral antagonists in treating genetic diseases caused by constitutively activating mutations in GPCRs. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {PKA holoenzymes containing two catalytic (C) subunits and a regulatory (R) subunit dimer are activated cooperatively by cAMP. While cooperativity involves the two tandem cAMP binding domains in each R-subunit, additional cooperativity is associated with the tetramer. Of critical importance is the flexible linker in R that contains an inhibitor site (IS). While the IS becomes ordered in the R:C heterodimer, the overall conformation of the tetramer is mediated largely by the N-Linker that connects the D/D domain to the IS. To understand how the N-Linker contributes to assembly of tetrameric holoenzymes, we engineered a monomeric RI$\alpha$ that contains most of the N-Linker, RI$\alpha$(73-244), and crystallized a holoenzyme complex. Part of the N-linker is now ordered by interactions with a symmetry-related dimer. This complex of two symmetry-related dimers forms a tetramer that reveals novel mechanisms for allosteric regulation and has many features associated with full-length holoenzyme. A model of the tetrameric holoenzyme, based on this structure, is consistent with previous small angle X-ray and neutron scattering data, and is validated with new SAXS data and with an RI$\alpha$ mutation localized to a novel interface unique to the tetramer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as ‘predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

abstract = {Allostery is the process by which biological macromolecules (mostly proteins) transmit the effect of binding at one site to another, often distal, functional site, allowing for regulation of activity. Recent experimental observations demonstrating that allostery can be facilitated by dynamic and intrinsically disordered proteins have resulted in a new paradigm for understanding allosteric mechanisms, which focuses on the conformational ensemble and the statistical nature of the interactions responsible for the transmission of information. Analysis of allosteric ensembles reveals a rich spectrum of regulatory strategies, as well as a framework to unify the description of allosteric mechanisms from different systems.},

abstract = {The lactose (lac) repressor is an allosteric protein that can respond to environmental changes. Mutations introduced into the DNA binding domain and the effector binding pocket affect the repressor's ability to respond to its environment. We have demonstrated how the observed phenotype is a consequence of altering the thermodynamic equilibrium constants. We discuss mutant repressors, which (1) show tighter repression; (2) induce with a previously noninducing species, orthonitrophenyl-$\beta$-d-galactoside; and (3) transform an inducible switch to one that is corepressed. The ability of point mutations to change multiple thermodynamic constants, and hence drastically alter the repressor's phenotype, shows how allosteric proteins can perform a wide array of similar yet distinct functions such as that exhibited in the Lac/Gal family of bacterial repressors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a cation-selective, ligand-gated ion channel, involved in signal transmission at the chemical synapse. This paper reports the three-dimensional appearance of the channel in the closed conformation, at 9 A resolution. The structure was determined by electron microscopy of tubular crystals of Torpedo postsynaptic membranes embedded in amorphous ice. The analysis was carried out by averaging data from separate images, using helical diffraction methods. The images were recorded over a wide range of defocus (7000 to 18,800 A) so that all spacings in the object were well sampled. Tubes of only one kind ((-16.6) helical family) were processed, so that the Fourier terms could be averaged directly in reciprocal space. The three-dimensional map, obtained from 26 images, resolves some elements of secondary structure within the five protein subunits. In the synaptic part of each subunit, about 30 A from the bilayer surface, there is a group of three rods that are oriented predominantly perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer and twist around each other as in a left-handed coil. These rods presumably are alpha-helices. Two of them line the entrance to the channel, and the third is on the outside. The distinctive appearance of the alpha subunits in this region suggests that the rods may be involved in forming the binding pocket for acetylcholine. In the bilayer-spanning part of each subunit there is only one rod clearly visible, which forms the wall lining the pore, and so is assumed to be the transmembrane helix, M2. This rod does not form a straight path through the lipid bilayer, but bends, or kinks, near its mid-point, where it is closest to the axis of the pore, and tilts radially outwards on either side. It is flanked on the lipid-facing sides by a continuous rim of density, which seems likely to be composed of beta-sheet. A tentative alignment is made between the three-dimensional densities and the sequence of M2, based on correlation of the appearance of the rods with a special pattern of amino acid residues in the sequence. This alignment places the charged groups at the ends of M2 symmetrically on either side of the bilayer, and a highly conserved leucine residue (Leu251 of the alpha subunit) at the level of the kink.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Allosteric enzymes pervade metabolic processes, yet a simple and unified treatment of the effects of allostery in enzymes has been lacking. In this work, we take the first step towards this goal by modeling allosteric enzymes and their interaction with two key molecular players - allosteric regulators and competitive inhibitors.

abstract = {Lipid rafts are hypothesized to facilitate protein interaction, tension regulation, and trafficking in biological membranes, but the mechanisms responsible for their formation and maintenance are not clear. Insights into many other condensed matter phenomena have come from colloidal systems, whose micron-scale particles mimic basic properties of atoms and molecules but permit dynamic visualization with single-particle resolution. Recently, experiments showed that bidisperse mixtures of filamentous viruses can self-assemble into colloidal monolayers with thermodynamically stable rafts exhibiting chiral structure and repulsive interactions. We quantitatively explain these observations by modeling the membrane particles as chiral liquid crystals. Chiral twist promotes the formation of finite-sized rafts and mediates a repulsion that distributes them evenly throughout the membrane. Although this system is composed of filamentous viruses whose aggregation is entropically driven by dextran depletants instead of phospholipids and cholesterol with prominent electrostatic interactions, colloidal and biological membranes share many of the same physical symmetries. Chiral twist can contribute to the behavior of both systems and may account for certain stereospecific effects observed in molecular membranes.},

The novel promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. Escherichia coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as AraC from chromosomally located expression units provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products. The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.},

These 10 residues, therefore, are exposed in the channel lumen. The pattern of exposure is compatible with an $\alpha$ helix, interrupted by an extended structure from Leu-250 to Ser-252. Acetylcholine caused subtle changes in the accessibilities of some of the engineered cysteines.

Drugs targeting fundamental cellular processes such DNA-replication and microtubule function, often referred to as “chemotherapy” and still the backbone of most cancer treatment regimens, are increasingly being complemented by or replaced with kinase inhibitors. This new class of drugs targets enzymes which provide growth and survival signals to cancer cells by transferring phosphate groups from Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to other proteins, lipids, nucleotides, and carbohydrates. This book summarizes the current state of kinase inhibitor therapy for cancer. Successful drug development relies on the expertise and dedication of many experts. To reflect this team approach to finding new kinase inhibitors and defining their optimal use for cancer treatment, the editors invited experts in academia and pharmaceutical industry to share their insights into various aspects of this process, ranging from the first chemical screens, to preclinical testing and disease-focused clinical drug development. The editors and authors hope these lessons will be instructive for the novice as well as the expert.},

Based on the model and the existing data, responses of all of the strains (studied in this article) to the presence of any combinations of ligand (Ser and MeAsp) concentrations are predicted quantitatively for future experimental verification. Through modeling the in vivo response data, our study reveals important information about the properties of different types of individual receptors, as well as the composition of the cluster. The energetic contribution of the nonligand binding, cytoplasmic parts of the cluster, such as CheA and CheW, is also discussed.

However, the multiplicity of regulatory interactions at control elements makes their theoretical and experimental characterisation difficult. Here a thermodynamic framework to describe gene regulation by distant enhancers via a chromatin mechanism is developed. In this mechanism transcription factors (TFs) modulate gene expression via shifts in the equilibrium between chromatin states. The designs of AND, OR, XOR and NAND two-input transcriptional gates for the chromatin mechanism are proposed and compared to similar gates based on the direct physical interactions of TFs with the transcriptional machinery. An algorithm is developed to estimate the thermodynamic parameters of chromatin mechanism gates from gene expression reporter data and applied to characterise the response function for the Gata2-3 enhancer in hematopoietic stem cells. In addition waiting-time distributions for transcriptionally active states were analysed to expose the biophysical differences between the contact and chromatin mechanisms. These differences can be experimentally observed in single-cell experiments and therefore can serve as a signature of the gene regulation mechanism. Taken together these results indicate the diverse functionality and unique features of the chromatin mechanism of combinatorial gene regulation.},

abstract = {Gene expression actualizes the organismal phenotypes encoded within the genome in an environment-dependent manner. Among all encoded phenotypes, cell population growth rate (fitness) is perhaps the most important, since it determines how well-adapted a genotype is in various environments. Traditional biological measurement techniques have revealed the connection between the environment and fitness based on the gene expression mean. Yet, recently it became clear that cells with identical genomes exposed to the same environment can differ dramatically from the population average in their gene expression and division rate (individual fitness). For cell populations with bimodal gene expression, this difference is particularly pronounced, and may involve stochastic transitions between two cellular states that form distinct sub-populations. Currently it remains unclear how a cell population's growth rate and its subpopulation fractions emerge from the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks and the division rates of single cells. To address this question we developed and quantitatively characterized an inducible, bistable synthetic gene circuit controlling the expression of a bifunctional antibiotic resistance gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following fitness and fluorescence measurements in two distinct environments (inducer alone and antibiotic alone), we applied a computational approach to predict cell population fitness and subpopulation fractions in the combination of these environments based on stochastic cellular movement in gene expression space and fitness space. We found that knowing the fitness and nongenetic (cellular) memory associated with specific gene expression states were necessary for predicting the overall fitness of cell populations in combined environments. We validated these predictions experimentally and identified environmental conditions that defined a "sweet spot" of drug resistance. These findings may provide a roadmap for connecting the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks to cell population fitness in well-defined environments, and may have important implications for phenotypic variability of drug resistance in natural settings.},

Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and colonization of E. coli using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability.},

abstract = {Genes are regulated because their expression involves a fitness cost to the organism. The production of proteins by transcription and translation is a well-known cost factor, but the enzymatic activity of the proteins produced can also reduce fitness, depending on the internal state and the environment of the cell. Here, we map the fitness costs of a key metabolic network, the lactose utilization pathway in Escherichia coli.We measure the growth of several regulatory lac operon mutants in different environments inducing expression of the lac genes. We find a strikingly nonlinear fitness landscape, which depends on the production rate and on the activity rate of the lac proteins. A simple fitness model of the lac pathway, based on elementary biophysical processes, predicts the growth rate of all observed strains. The nonlinearity of fitness is explained by a feedback loop: production and activity of the lac proteins reduce growth, but growth also affects the density of these molecules. This nonlinearity has important consequences for molecular function and evolution. It generates a cliff in the fitness landscape, beyond which populations cannot maintain growth. In viable populations, there is an expression barrier of the lac genes, which cannot be exceeded in any stationary growth process. Furthermore, the nonlinearity determines how the fitness of operon mutants depends on the inducer environment. We argue that fitness nonlinearities, expression barriers, and gene–environment interactions are generic features of fitness landscapes for metabolic pathways, and we discuss their implications for the evolution of regulation.

The environment is represented by the state of the gene (active or inactive). The protein population size is ruled by the birth-and-death process. Proteins can be produced by the gene when it is activated (birth). They can disappear as well due to their denaturation (death). The distribution of the protein number is computed explicitly for both the transient and stationary cases. It is shown that three out of the four parameters of the model can be estimated from an observed sample of protein numbers collected during the stationary regime.},

@article{Elowitz2002,
abstract = {Clonal populations of cells exhibit substantial phenotypic variation. Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

@article{Taylor2007,
abstract = {The growth rate of organisms depends both on external conditions and on internal states, such as the expression levels of various genes. We show that to achieve a criterion mean growth rate over an ensemble of conditions, the internal variables must carry a minimum number of bits of information about those conditions. Evolutionary competition thus can select for cellular mechanisms that are more efficient in an abstract, information theoretic sense. Estimates based on recent experiments suggest that the minimum information required for reasonable growth rates is close to the maximum information that can be conveyed through biologically realistic regulatory mechanisms. These ideas are applicable most directly to unicellular organisms, but there are analogies to problems in higher organisms, and we suggest new experiments for both cases.},

@article{Dekel2005,
abstract = {Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment. Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth. We experimentally measured the growth burden due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost-benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},
annote = {Very interesting paper where Uri measures the cost and the benefit of producing lacZ independently and the non-linearity of the cost function gives a global optimal expression level for the operon.
Then they go to evolve for ≈500 generations (6.6 per day) E. coli at different lactose concentrations finding out that after such a short time the expression level falls into the predicted one.

Very interesting for my idea since they show that selection acted to optimize the expression level, but only for a single static environment. I would extend this to a varying environment with a MUCH STRONGER selection.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {By defining mutual information as a maximum over an appropriate space, channel capacities can be defined as double maxima and rate-distortion functions as double minima. This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algo- rithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing ram-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algo- rithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source.},

abstract = {Signaling pathways often transmit multiple signals through a single shared transcription factor (TF) and encode signal information by differentially regulating TF dynamics. However, signal information will be lost unless it can be reliably decoded by downstream genes. To understand the limits on dynamic information transduction, we apply information theory to quantify how much gene expression information the yeast TF Msn2 can transduce to target genes in the amplitude or frequency of its activation dynamics. We find that although the amount of information transmitted by Msn2 to single target genes is limited, information transduction can be increased by modulating promoter cis-elements or by integrating information from multiple genes. By correcting for extrinsic noise, we estimate an upper bound on information transduction. Overall, we find that information transduction through amplitude and frequency regulation of Msn2 is limited to error-free transduction of signal identity, but not signal intensity information.},

In a manner similar to genetic evolution, increasing the noise in biochemical processes correlates with improved response of the system to environmental changes.},

With increasing regularity, the transcriptional outputs from different promoters are being measured in quantitative detail in single-cell experiments thus providing the impetus for the development of quantitative models of transcription. We describe recent progress in developing models of transcriptional regulation that incorporate, to different degrees, the complexity of multi-state promoter dynamics, and its effect on the transcriptional outputs of single cells. The goal of these models is to predict the statistical properties of transcriptional outputs and characterize their variability in time and across a population of cells, as a function of the input concentrations of transcription factors. The interplay between mathematical models of different regulatory mechanisms and quantitative biophysical experiments holds the promise of elucidating the molecular-scale mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in cells, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes.},
