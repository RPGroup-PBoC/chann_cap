  Given the stochastic nature of gene expression, genetically identical cells
  exposed to the same environmental inputs will produce different outputs. This
  heterogeneity has consequences for how cells are able to survive in changing
  environments. Recent work has explored the use of information theory as a
  framework to understand the accuracy with which cells can ascertain the state
  of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these approaches is
  limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision measurements. To
  that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic circuit in which
  all parameter values for the model come from independently published data
  sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of the genetic
  circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy number and
  protein-DNA affinity. We compare these parameter-free predictions with an
  experimental determination of protein distributions and the information
  processing capacity of {\it E. coli} cells, and find that our minimal model
  describes the experimental data within a systematic multiplicative deviation.
  This work conglomerates the state of the art in modeling gene regulation,
  highlighting where we stand as a community towards the objective of
  understanding the physics of how cells respond to the environment.
