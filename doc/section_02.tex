\section{Results}

To test our theory, we measured the gene expression distribution for a synthetic
circuit. \fref[figFullProfile] shows the data for different O2 strains with
varying numbers of the Lac repressor $R$ spanning two orders of magnitude.
Overlaid on this data is the theory from
\eref[eqGeneExpressionDistributionFastRates].

We next computed the channel capacity for the Lac system using
\eref[eqChannelCapacity], as shown in \fref[figChannelCapacity].
