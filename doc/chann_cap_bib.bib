How is the information contained in multiple TF-binding sites integrated to dictate the rate of transcription? The dominant conceptual and quantitative model is that TFs combinatorially recruit one another and RNA polymerase to the promoter by direct physical interactions. Here, we develop a quantitative framework to explore kinetic control, an alternative model in which combinatorial gene regulation can result from TFs working on different kinetic steps of the transcription cycle. Kinetic control can generate a wide range of analog and Boolean computations without requiring the input TFs to be simultaneously bound to regulatory DNA. We propose experiments that will illuminate the role of kinetic control in transcription and discuss implications for deciphering the cis-regulatory “code.”},

abstract = {Transcription is the dominant point of control of gene expression. Biochemical studies have revealed key molecular components of transcription and their interactions, but the dynamics of transcription initiation in cells is still poorly understood. This state of affairs is being remedied with experiments that observe transcriptional dynamics in single cells using fluorescent reporters. Quantitative information about transcription initiation dynamics can also be extracted from experiments that use electron micrographs of RNA polymerases caught in the act of transcribing a gene (Miller spreads). Inspired by these data, we analyze a general stochastic model of transcription initiation and elongation and compute the distribution of transcription initiation times. We show that different mechanisms of initiation leave distinct signatures in the distribution of initiation times that can be compared to experiments. We analyze published data from micrographs of RNA polymerases transcribing ribosomal RNA genes in Escherichia coli and compare the observed distributions of interpolymerase distances with the predictions from previously hypothesized mechanisms for the regulation of these genes. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of measuring the distribution of time intervals between initiation events as a probe for dissecting mechanisms of transcription initiation in live cells.},

abstract = {The biochemical processes leading to the synthesis of new proteins are random, as they typically involve a small number of diffusing molecules. They lead to fluctuations in the number of proteins in a single cell as a function of time and to cell-to-cell variability of protein abundances. These in turn can lead to phenotypic heterogeneity in a population of genetically identical cells. Phenotypic heterogeneity may have important consequences for the development of multicellular organisms and the fitness of bacterial colonies, raising the question of how it is regulated. Here we review the experimental evidence that transcriptional regulation affects noise in gene expression, and discuss how the noise strength is encoded in the architecture of the promoter region. We discuss how models based on specific molecular mechanisms of gene regulation can make experimentally testable predictions for how changes to the promoter architecture are reflected in gene expression noise.

This is the second time I read this paper, first time I read it since it came out in Cell. The reason I read this paper at this time was because I was contacted by Quanta Magazine to give my insight into this amazing piece of work. This happened because Jane Kondev gave them my contact and now I'll be interviewed to talk about what I think of this paper.
The paper asks a very concise question, given that they have shown in the past that the gap genes - hunchback (hb), Kru¨ppel (Kr), knirps (kni), and giant (gt) - carry enough information for a developing embryo to decide all of its cell fates in early development, are the embryos actually just using these signals to set the body plan? In other words, these genes seem to carry enough bits to set the cellular fate of all cells in the early developmental stages, but that does not mean that cells actually use these signals as the readout of positional information. So the question is if we were to build an "optimal decoder" P(x* | {\{}g{\_}i{\}}), i.e. the probability of being in position x* given the gene expression {\{}g{\_}i{\}}, would that suffice to predict morphological features of the body plan?
Gregor and company go and analyze data having measured simultaneously the 4 gap genes along with a downstream pair-rule genes that determine the characteristic stripes in development. What they found is that indeed the optimal decoder seems to be what cells use to determine their position along the embryo. This implies that cells make use of these noisy signals to decide on which part of the embryo are they located, and they do this with an exquisite precision. Moreover these optimal decoder is somehow encoded in the promoter-enhance architecture of these genes, so upon changing the spacial profile of the gap genes by mutating upstream genes, the dictionary should be able to predict changes in the morphological features of these mutant embryos. The authors show that indeed their optimal decoder is able to predict stripes positions in mutants, again suggesting that the information contained in these morphogen gradients is what the cells use to determine their position along the embryo.
The paper is a beautiful example of the power of abstraction in biology. All of the molecular details underlying how these optimal decoder work are not necessary to make testable predictions about the system. One doesn't need to know all of the specific details in order to make progress in understanding the system. The theory-experiment dialogue presented here is inspiring as we pursue these reigning principles of biological systems. I am a huge fan of the paper.},

abstract = {We have determined whether or not there is a correlation between the accuracy of tRNA selection and the processivity of translation by mutant ribosomes. In our assay the estimation of processivity was made from a system in which transcription is dependent on T7 RNA polymerase in order to eliminate the influence of transcriptional polarity on our measurements. We found that the processivity of translation is reciprocally correlated to the degree with which mutant ribosomes restrict nonsense suppression events. This is observed when transcription is from both T7 RNA polymerase and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. In other words, we have confirmed the expected correlation between increased accuracy of tRNA selection and decreased processivity of translation. No such monotonic correlation was obtained with ribosome ambiguity (ram) mutants, though all of these were less processive than wild-type ribosomes. In addition, streptomycin was found to simultaneously stimulate tRNA selection errors and processivity of translation for a mutant that is partially dependent on streptomycin. These data suggest that the growth rates of ribosome mutants are significantly decreased by the degree to which their processivity in translation is affected. Furthermore, we suggest that streptomycin dependence is a phenomenon reflecting the interplay of the restrictive mutation and antibiotic on the processivity of translation. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press Limited.},

It is particularly difficult to analyze a promoter sequence and identify the locations, regulatory roles, and energetic properties of binding sites for transcription factors and RNA polymerase. In this work, we present a strategy for interpreting transcriptional regulatory sequences using in vivo methods (i.e. the massively parallel reporter assay Sort-Seq) to formulate quantitative models that map a transcription factor binding site's DNA sequence to transcription factor-DNA binding energy. We use these models to predict the binding energies of transcription factor binding sites to within 1 kBT of their measured values. We further explore how such a sequence-energy mapping relates to the mechanisms of trancriptional regulation in various promoter contexts. Specifically, we show that our models can be used to design specific induction responses, analyze the effects of amino acid mutations on DNA sequence preference, and determine how regulatory context affects a transcription factor's sequence specificity.},

Using a new method for persister generation and high-throughput methods, we comprehensively mapped the molecular phenotype of Escherichia coli during the entry and in the state of persistence in nutrient-rich conditions. The persister proteome is characterized by $\sigma$(S)-mediated stress response and a shift to catabolism, a proteome that starved cells tried to but could not reach due to absence of a carbon and energy source. Metabolism of persisters is geared toward energy production, with depleted metabolite pools. We developed and experimentally verified a model, in which persistence is established through a system-level feedback: Strong perturbations of metabolic homeostasis cause metabolic fluxes to collapse, prohibiting adjustments toward restoring homeostasis. This vicious cycle is stabilized and modulated by high ppGpp levels, toxin/anti-toxin systems, and the $\sigma$(S)-mediated stress response. Our system-level model consistently integrates past findings with our new data, thereby providing an important basis for future research on persisters.},

The question behind this Johan Elf's paper is to address whether or not using equilibrium models for gene regulation makes sense. The way they tackle this is by performing single molecule measurements of the time that the lac repressor spends bound to the promoter. To measure this in a single cell they had two types of lac repressor:
1. LacI-Venus fusion that does not respond to IPTG (this in low copy numbers)
2. WT LacI (this in high copy numbers)
The idea of the method was that at time zero the media was changed from saturating IPTG to no IPTG. Before exchanging the media they claim that only the fluorescent LacI-Venus could bind to the operator. Once the media was changed, if the repressor fell off the operator it would most likely be replaced by the other non-fluorescence repressors.
In order to visualize the repressor bound to the operator they performed a 4 s exposure. Only bound immobile repressors would show up in the image as a puncta, while the unbound ones would be blurred away by diffusion. In this way by performing this exposures at different time points, and counting how the fraction of bound repressors decayed over time, they could infer the average residency of the repressor on the operator. They also were able to determine the average time it took for the repressor to bind to the operator.
The paper then goes to discuss that the equilibrium picture doesn't agree with the expected repression measurements. The authors propose different non-equilibrium pictures that could solve the discrepancies, but I honestly didn't like the treatment and carefulness of this part at all. After all the Elf lab is as good as it gets with respect to single molecule in-vivo imaging of transcription factors, but I don't think of them as hardcore theorists carefully thinking about these models.},

In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},
annote = {This is Ido's most classic paper and I am surprised I am reading it so late in my career with Rob. In this super interesting paper Ido and company use MS2-GFP constructs to observe transcriptional events in E. coli. By placing an RFP followed by 96 MS2 loops they could correlate transcription and translation of the same transcript.
After convincing themselves (and the reader) that the loops do not interfere with the transcription, they go on and test a simple model with Poissonian production of transcripts. As I would have expected, the cell-to-cell variability was significantly higher, therefore they eliminate this option as a viable mechanism for how transcription works. Their data empirically suggested that transcription is a bursty process, having multiple mRNA production events happening consecutively. Their data, such as mean mRNA copy number after induction, fraction of cells without a transcript after induction and the noise, seem to fit a model in which gene expression is a bursty process. As shown in this time trajectory, every time a cell starts producing mRNA, it produces several at the time, and then has long pauses with no transcription. The authors give several suggestive speculations for why mRNA production might be bursty in prokaryotes as well.
This is very much in the spirit of the kind of experiments that we like to do here in the lab. That is why Ido is such a common name we throw as one of the leaders of the field.

abstract = {Cells must sense extracellular signals and transfer the information contained about their environment reliably to make appropriate decisions. To perform these tasks, cells use signal transduction networks that are subject to various sources of noise. Here, we study the effects on information transfer of two particular types of noise: basal (leaky) network activity and cell-to-cell variability in the componentry of the network. Basal activity is the propensity for activation of the network output in the absence of the signal of interest. We show, using theoretical models of protein kinase signaling, that the combined effect of the two types of noise makes information transfer by such networks highly vulnerable to the loss of negative feedback. In an experimental study of ERK signaling by single cells with heterogeneous ERK expression levels, we verify our theoretical prediction: In the presence of basal network activity, negative feedback substantially increases information transfer to the nucleus by both preventing a near-flat average response curve and reducing sensitivity to variation in substrate expression levels. The interplay between basal network activity, heterogeneity in network componentry, and feedback is thus critical for the effectiveness of protein kinase signaling. Basal activity is widespread in signaling systems under physiological conditions, has phenotypic consequences, and is often raised in disease. Our results reveal an important role for negative feedback mechanisms in protecting the information transfer function of saturable, heterogeneous cell signaling systems from basal activity.},
annote = {Interesting paper that studies the effect of negative feedback in information transfer.

The paper basically first develops a theoretical model where a kinase signaling pathway includes basal activity (leakiness) and noise in expression levels. They note that when they include some sort of negative feedback the information transfer gets much better.

So then they go and test this with a complicated PK signaling pathway in HeLa cells and show that indeed if they knock out the feedback loop (using siRNA) the information transfer as measured with quantitative fluorescence decreases abruptly.

This could be interesting for me to test with the lac system by including either feedback to repress or activate the production of the repressor, or something along those lines. Let's think about it.},

abstract = {Large scale models of physical phenomena demand the development of new statistical and computational tools in order to be effective. Many such models are `sloppy', i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher Information Matrix, which we interpret as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. We show how the manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

abstract = {Half a century has passed since the discovery of operons (groups of genes that are transcribed together as a single mRNA). Despite the importance of operons in bacterial gene networks, the relationship between their organization and gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we show using synthetic operons in Escherichia coli that the expression of a given gene increases with the length of the operon and as its position moves farther from the end of the operon. These findings can be explained by a common mechanism; increasing the distance from the start of a gene to the end of the operon (termed the "transcription distance") provides more time for translation to occur during transcription, resulting in increased expression. We confirmed experimentally that the increased expression is indeed due to increased translation. Furthermore our analysis indicates the translation initiation rate for an mRNA is sixfold greater during transcription than after its release, which amplifies the impact of the transcription distance on gene expression. As a result of these mechanisms, gene expression increases by ∼40{\%} for each 1,000 nucleotides of transcription distance. In summary, we demonstrate that a fundamental relationship exists between gene expression and the number, length, and order of the genes in an operon. This relationship has important implications for understanding the functional basis of genome organization and practical applications for synthetic biology.},

A Very relevant paper for my project this is the second time I read this paper. In this work Elf, Gene-Wei Li and Sunney Xie perform some interesting microscopy on the lac repressor. They create a fusion that can dimerize (but not form tetramers) with the YFP-venus protein and lower the expression level of WT to ≈ 3 repressors/cell by putting an O1 binding site at the natural O3 operator position (claiming there is auto regulation). Then they image the repressor at different time intervals and when they see puncta after a 1 s exposure time they claim that it is bound to an operator, when they see no punch they claim that it is not bound (having done allegedly the controls to show that it is not photobleaching). They can add IPTG and see that the puncta disappears, they can also add an IPTG competitor and see how IPTG re-binds the operator.
From these type of measurements along with other clever imaging techniques they can infer a diffusion constant for the 3D search, and using some in-vitro experiments they can determine the diffusion constant for the 1D sliding.
Interesting and cool paper, but I must say that Rob told me he has become slightly skeptical of these results over the years. He wouldn't say why but I must keep that in mind.},

@article{Peterson2015,
abstract = {SignificanceGene expression noise affects a cells biological state and contributes to such phenomena as phenotype switching and cell fate determination. By examining chromosome replication--which is tightly controlled and thus exhibits little noise--we show that variability in mRNA levels across a population is less than previously expected. This noise is due to the transient relaxation of the mRNA from a low- to a high-copy steady state after a gene replication event. Gene location, mRNA degradation rate, and cell doubling time all contribute to observed noise. Our results demonstrate that it is essential to account for gene replication when modelling gene expression or when interpreting experimental results. There are several sources of fluctuations in gene expression. Here we study the effects of time-dependent DNA replication, itself a tightly controlled process, on noise in mRNA levels. Stochastic simulations of constitutive and regulated gene expression are used to analyze the time-averaged mean and variation in each case. The simulations demonstrate that to capture mRNA distributions correctly, chromosome replication must be realistically modeled. Slow relaxation of mRNA from the low copy number steady state before gene replication to the high steady state after replication is set by the transcripts half-life and contributes significantly to the shape of the mRNA distribution. Consequently both the intrinsic kinetics and the gene location play an important role in accounting for the mRNA average and variance. Exact analytic expressions for moments of the mRNA distributions that depend on the DNA copy number, gene location, cell doubling time, and the rates of transcription and degradation are derived for the case of constitutive expression and subsequently extended to provide approximate corrections for regulated expression and RNA polymerase variability. Comparisons of the simulated models and analytical expressions to experimentally measured mRNA distributions show that they better capture the physics of the system than previous theories.},
annote = {This paper sent by Brewster is one of the two papers that followed up his Science paper. In this paper they explore via simulations and analytical work the effect of multiple gene copies during the cell cycle. They claim that the transients are important and once there are two copies of the gene as expected the mRNA copy number relaxes to twice the original amount with a time-scale determined by the mRNA degradation rate.
The paper has some interesting analytical work in which they give some of the rates a random-variable nature rather than a deterministic parameter to include RNAP and transcription factor copy number variability. It would be very interesting to go through these calculations for the Pyramid paper, but for now there are too many details I would like to ignore in my analysis.

2018-05-06
This is the second time I read this paper, this time with different eyes. Now that I am exploring the effect of having multiple gene copies on my own project this study suddenly becomes extremely relevant.
The claim of the paper is pretty simple: noise coming from gene replication is important.
What this means is that depending on the position of the gene along the genome and the growth rate a promoter can have multiple copies. This turns out to affect the overall noise. As shown in Fig. 1 the gene duplicates and then the mRNA has to relax to its new equilibrium value. This relaxation depends on the mRNA degradation rate and it might or might not be accurate to assume the mRNA count reaches steady state. 
For this paper they assume a one-state promoter and claim that they can "fit" to Daniel and Brewster's data just by accounting for this noise source given by the multi-copy case. They work out some analytical expression for the mean and fano-factor and perform some Gillespie simulations to show the improvement that their time-dependent theory gives.
What worries me about this study is the fact that there seem to be endless details to get the "correct theory." It is a little bit overwhelming to think of all the possible unaccountable things for the theory to be right. So when trying to do biophysics and trying to obtain what we claim are meaningful parameters, for these kinetic models it is hard to tells whether or not we are right. Maybe is just a weak point on my faith on the process, but I find right now that what I'm trying to do overly ambitious and maybe meaningless.},

@article{Lassig2017,
annote = {An incredibly inspiring perspective from L{\"{a}}ssig and my new crush Alecksandra Walczak. In this paper they discuss about the emerging field of predictive evolution. Specifically they focus on the scenario where selection is strong enough that from the complex trait space there is one single most likely outcome, allowing for prediction.
They discuss how different mutations give rise to same functional outcomes and give examples of this. This simplifying fact tells us that we do not need to predict the exact mutation landscape to still have predictive power over phenotypic outcomes. They then discuss the role of negative (stabilizing) and positive (directional) selection in creating a single evolutionary outcome. They show a simple intuitive example of a "fitness seascape" where there is an adaptive trait that is changing its optimal value over time (for example affinity of a antigen to an antibody) and a conserve trait that has to be kept constant (for example protein stability). Given these two complementary traits one can predict the outcome of two competing clades.
Overall the paper is an amazing read that I should read multiple times to digest all the beautiful content on it.

2018-06-25
Reading again this fantastic review as I run a project at MBL is a great source of inspiration. In this perspective L{\"{a}}ssig and Alecks present an intriguing idea of predicting evolutionary outcomes on short time scales. This idea, close to my heart and to my scientific goal in the near future poses fascinating theoretical and experimental challenges. In rapidly evolving systems such as microbial and viral populations the idea of clonal interference seems to dominate the dynamics of the population. But despite the 'microscopic' irreproducibility of evolution (i.e. the fact that the sequence space is so large) there are some 'macroscopic' properties that if correctly mapped can allow for formal predictions of evolutionary dynamics (i.e. the fact that many mutations map to equivalent phenotypes).
There are a lot of interesting ideas and tons of must-read references in this paper. It will keep bringing inspiration for years to come.},

abstract = {Probability reigns in biology, with random molecular events dictating the fate of individual organisms, and propelling populations of species through evolution. In principle, the master probability equation provides the most complete model of probabilistic behavior in biomolecular networks. In practice, master equations describing complex reaction networks have remained unsolved for over 70 years. This practical challenge is a reason why master equations, for all their potential, have not inspired biological discovery. Herein, we present a closure scheme that solves the master probability equation of networks of chemical or biochemical reactions. We cast the master equation in terms of ordinary differential equations that describe the time evolution of probability distribution moments. We postulate that a finite number of moments capture all of the necessary information, and compute the probability distribution and higher-order moments by maximizing the information entropy of the system. An accurate order closure is selected, and the dynamic evolution of molecular populations is simulated. Comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which merely sample the probability distribution, demonstrates this closure scheme is accurate for several small reaction networks. The importance of this result notwithstanding, a most striking finding is that the steady state of stochastic reaction networks can now be readily computed in a single-step calculation, without the need to simulate the evolution of the probability distribution in time.},

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

abstract = {Moment approximation methods are gaining increasing attention for their use in the approximation of the stochastic kinetics of chemical reaction systems. In this paper we derive a general moment expansion method for any type of propensities and which allows expansion up to any number of moments. For some chemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the dynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation is unable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have a strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give information about higher order moments of the underlying probability distribution. We demonstrate the method using a dimerisation reaction, Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a model of an oscillating p53 system. We show that for the dimerisation reaction and Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics system higher order moments have limited influence on the estimation of the mean, while for the p53 system, the solution for the mean can require several moments to converge to the average obtained from many stochastic simulations. We also find that agreement between lower order moments does not guarantee that higher moments will agree. Compared to stochastic simulations, our approach is numerically highly efficient at capturing the behaviour of stochastic systems in terms of the average and higher moments, and we provide expressions for the computational cost for different system sizes and orders of approximation. We show how the moment expansion method can be employed to efficiently quantify parameter sensitivity. Finally we investigate the effects of using too few moments on parameter estimation, and provide guidance on how to estimate if the distribution can be accurately approximated using only a few moments.},

The inherent complexity of even the simplest biological systems, however, often precludes achieving such predictive power. A prototypical example is the lac operon, one of the best-characterized genetic systems, which still poses serious challenges for understanding the results of combining its parts into novel setups. The reason is the pervasive complex hierarchy of events involved in gene regulation that extend from specific protein-DNA interactions to the combinatorial assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we integrate such complexity into a few-parameter model to accurately predict gene expression from a few simple rules to connect the parts. The model accurately reproduces the observed transcriptional activity of the lac operon over a 10,000-fold range for 21 different operator setups, different repressor concentrations, and tetrameric and dimeric forms of the repressor. Incorporation of the calibrated model into more complex scenarios accurately captures the induction curves for key operator configurations and the temporal evolution of the $\beta$-galactosidase activity of cell populations.},

Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise.

abstract = {Cell signaling can be thought of fundamentally as an information transmission problem in which chemical messengers relay information about the external environment to the decision centers within a cell. Due to the biochemical nature of cellular signal transduction networks, molecular noise will inevitably limit the fidelity of any messages received and processed by a cell's signal transduction networks, leaving it with an imperfect impression of its environment. Fortunately, Shannon's information theory provides a mathematical framework independent of network complexity that can quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted despite biochemical noise. In particular, the channel capacity can be used to measure the maximum number of stimuli a cell can distinguish based upon the noisy responses of its signaling systems. Here, we provide a primer for quantitative biologists that covers fundamental concepts of information theory, highlights several key considerations when experimentally measuring channel capacity, and describes successful examples of the application of information theoretic analysis to biological signaling.},

abstract = {We investigate cellular response to extracellular signals by using information theory techniques motivated by recent experiments. We present results for the steady state of the following gene regulatory models found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells: a linear transcription-translation model and a positive or negative auto-regulatory model. We calculate both the information capacity and the mutual information exactly for simple models and approximately for the full model. We find that (1) small changes in mutual information can lead to potentially important changes in cellular response and (2) there are diminishing returns in the fidelity of response as the mutual information increases. We calculate the information capacity using Gillespie simulations of a model for the TNF-$\alpha$-NF-$\kappa$ B network and find good agreement with the measured value for an experimental realization of this network. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the differences in cellular response when comparing experimentally measured mutual information values of different gene regulatory models. Our calculations demonstrate that Gillespie simulations can be used to compute the mutual information of more complex gene regulatory models, providing a potentially useful tool in synthetic biology.},
annote = {I hate this paper!

They stole my priviledge of being the first one to compute the channel capacity of a genetic circuit using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm...

But anyways, with respect to their science I think is not a super interesting paper. For me their big insight is that under the metric they use to determine if a cell expressed the right amount of a gene or not having less than 1 bit of information is actually useful.

In other words they study the response of cells to different environments (assuming a linear response between signal and gene expression, which I completely disagree) assuming that the cells can only have a binary response. Under this scenario part of the population is exposed to a low signal and it should therefore express a low amount, and the rest of the population is exposed to a high signal, having to express at high levels. Given that gene expression is noisy you'll find cells in the opposite phenotype as they should so the cells would have less than 1 bit of information because they can't even properly distinguish between high and low.

But what these guys find is that even if you have 0.35 bits of information that is "better than nothing" and actually getting the full bit turns out to be very hard having diminishing returns in how much better you do given that you increase your information processing capacity. This last point is analogous to what Bialek showed in his RD curves where you start getting more and more information, but the benefit in fitness is not as by anymore.

Overall I hate this paper because they stoled my glory :-(},

abstract = {Changes in a cell's external or internal conditions are usually reflected in the concentrations of the relevant transcription factors. These proteins in turn modulate the expression levels of the genes under their control and sometimes need to perform nontrivial computations that integrate several inputs and affect multiple genes. At the same time, the activities of the regulated genes would fluctuate even if the inputs were held fixed, as a consequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must fundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use information theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in simple genetic regulatory elements in the presence of physically realistic noise sources. The dependence of this "channel capacity" on noise parameters, cooperativity and cost of making signaling molecules is explored systematically. We find that, in the range of parameters probed by recent in vivo measurements, capacities higher than one bit should be achievable. It is of course generally accepted that gene regulatory elements must, in order to function properly, have a capacity of at least one bit. The central point of our analysis is the demonstration that simple physical models of noisy gene transcription, with realistic parameters, can indeed achieve this capacity: it was not self-evident that this should be so. We also demonstrate that capacities significantly greater than one bit are possible, so that transcriptional regulation need not be limited to simple "on-off" components. The question whether real systems actually exploit this richer possibility is beyond the scope of this investigation.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {Based on the measurements of noise in gene expression performed during the past decade, it has become customary to think of gene regulation in terms of a two-state model, where the promoter of a gene can stochastically switch between an ON and an OFF state. As experiments are becoming increasingly precise and the deviations from the two-state model start to be observable, we ask about the experimental signatures of complex multistate promoters, as well as the functional consequences of this additional complexity. In detail, we i), extend the calculations for noise in gene expression to promoters described by state transition diagrams with multiple states, ii), systematically compute the experimentally accessible noise characteristics for these complex promoters, and iii), use information theory to evaluate the channel capacities of complex promoter architectures and compare them with the baseline provided by the two-state model. We find that adding internal states to the promoter generically decreases channel capacity, except in certain cases, three of which (cooperativity, dual-role regulation, promoter cycling) we analyze in detail. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},
annote = {Incredibly important and relevant paper for my PhD project. Tkacik does a fantastic job of exploring how certain parameters change the information transmission of different promoter architectures. He focuses mainly in the two state promoter (the one that I am using for simple repression) and explores alternative more complex architectures, such as cooperative regulation and multiple state promoters to see if other architectures can transmit more information.

The authors model the noise using a langevin force which basically assumes the functional form of the noise is known. This is a very interesting approach since it simplifies enormously the math and allows the use of analytical tools such as the small noise approximation among other things. This could be a super interesting approach for my project if the parameter regime I use (the one that I believe is true given experimental evidence) allows it.

Overal I think that the paper could have explore other things such as how much information is lost at each step of the central dogma, and I think that the way I capture the induction using the MWC model is a more accurate version of this, but we defninitely share lots of ideas to the point that I think this paper scooped my idea of publishing a theory paper on my stuff.},

This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algo- rithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing ram-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algo- rithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source.},

We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

One thing to highlight is their explanation of the two main differences between information theory in biology vs. engineering: 
1) The first difference is that in Shannon's work, MI is used to describe information transfer by typically many uses of a channel, while in biology the focus has mostly been on a ‘single use', considering systems at steady-state
2) In engineering, the distribution of the input can be chosen by the user of the channel to maximize the MI, in order to maximize the number of distinguishable messages, but, in systems biology, the distribution of the signal is typically experienced and not chosen by the cell (with exceptions such as morphogens).

abstract = {The reproducibility and precision of biological patterning is limited by the accuracy with which concentration profiles of morphogen molecules can be established and read out by their targets. We consider four measures of precision for the Bicoid morphogen in the Drosophila embryo: the concentration differences that distinguish neighboring cells, the limits set by the random arrival of Bicoid molecules at their targets (which depends on absolute concentration), the noise in readout of Bicoid by the activation of Hunchback, and the reproducibility of Bicoid concentration at corresponding positions in multiple embryos. We show, through??a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are ???10{\%}. This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The main idea in the paper is that they generate a theoretical framework to decouple sources of variability in gene expression. With a set of proposed experiments and their theory they can distinguish the contribution of transcription, translation and other sources of noise to the overal variability.

One very interesting idea presented in the paper is the application of this theory to do "reverse ecology". By measuring the population level response to a range of signals (in this case yeast responding to osmotic stresses) they claim that if the information transduciton system is optimized to the environment found by the yeast in its natural environment they can infer the environment probability distribution from the population expression variability.

It is worth reading the paper again for sure!!},

Through a biochemical implementation of Bayes's rule, we show that genetic networks can act as inference modules, inferring from intracellular conditions the likely state of the extracellular environment and regulating gene expression appropriately. By considering a two-state environment, either poor or rich in nutrients, we show that promoter occupancy is proportional to the (posterior) probability of the high nutrient state given current intracellular information. We demonstrate that single-gene networks inferring and responding to a high environmental state infer best when negatively controlled, and those inferring and responding to a low environmental state infer best when positively controlled. Our interpretation is supported by experimental data from the lac operon and should provide a basis for both understanding more complex cellular decision-making and designing synthetic inference circuits.},

@article{Ziv2007,
abstract = {We quantify the influence of the topology of a transcriptional regulatory network on its ability to process environmental signals. By posing the problem in terms of information theory, we do this without specifying the function performed by the network. Specifically, we study the maximum mutual information between the input (chemical) signal and the output (genetic) response attainable by the network in the context of an analytic model of particle number fluctuations. We perform this analysis for all biochemical circuits, including various feedback loops, that can be built out of 3 chemical species, each under the control of one regulator. We find that a generic network, constrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can transduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to achieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These high-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the networks' biochemical parameters; moreover they are easier to achieve in networks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall negative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we derive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support multiple high-information solutions. These findings suggest a potential resolution of the "cross-talk" phenomenon as well as the previously unexplained observation that transcription factors that undergo proteolysis are more likely to be auto-repressive.},

abstract = {— When studying information, biolo-gists and behavioral scientists often eschew Shannon entropy. Instead, they commonly use a decision-theoretic measure of the value of information, on the grounds that Shannon's measure draws no distinction between useful and useless information. Here we show that these two measures are intimately related in the context of biological evolution. We present a sim-ple model of evolution in an uncertain environment, and calculate the increase in Darwinian fitness that is made possible by information about the environmen-tal state. This fitness increase — the fitness value of information — is a composite of both the Shannon entropy and the decision-theoretic measure of infor-mation value. Furthermore, the Shannon entropy of the environment, which seemingly fails to take any-thing about Darwinian fitness into account, nonethe-less imposes an upper bound on the fitness value of information.},

The model is based on calculating the maximum possible log growth rate in an organism with and without the capacity of predicting the environment he'll live in, i.e. with or without regulation of the genetic program. The difference in fitness turns out to be Shannon's entropy plus some linear terms which shows that the concept of information is intimately related to natural selection.},

@article{Brewster2012,
abstract = {One of the paramount goals of synthetic biology is to have the ability to tune transcriptional networks to targeted levels of expression at will. As a step in that direction, we have constructed a set of 18 unique binding sites for E. coli RNA Polymerase (RNAP) $\delta$⁷⁰ holoenzyme, designed using a model of sequence-dependent binding energy combined with a thermodynamic model of transcription to produce a targeted level of gene expression. This promoter set allows us to determine the correspondence between the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules or protein products and the predicted promoter binding energies measured in k(B)T energy units. These binding sites adhere on average to the predicted level of gene expression over 3 orders of magnitude in constitutive gene expression, to within a factor of 3 in both protein and mRNA copy number. With these promoters in hand, we then place them under the regulatory control of a bacterial repressor and show that again there is a strict correspondence between the measured and predicted levels of expression, demonstrating the transferability of the promoters to an alternate regulatory context. In particular, our thermodynamic model predicts the expression from our promoters under a range of repressor concentrations between several per cell up to over 100 per cell. After correcting the predicted polymerase binding strength using the data from the unregulated promoter, the thermodynamic model accurately predicts the expression for the simple repression strains to within 30{\%}. Demonstration of modular promoter design, where parts of the circuit (such as RNAP/TF binding strength and transcription factor copy number) can be independently chosen from a stock list and combined to give a predictable result, has important implications as an engineering tool for use in synthetic biology.},

However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number-in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits.

Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of {\~{}}1 along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise in gene expression satisfy certain matching relations, which we derive. These results provide parameter-free, quantitative predictions connecting independently measurable quantities. Although we have considered only the simplified problem of a single gene responding to a single TF, we find that these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo and that this system achieves approximately 90{\%} of its theoretical maximum information transmission.},

@article{Klumpp2008,
abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

@article{Bintu2005a,
abstract = {The expression of genes is regularly characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the "regulation factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

@article{Bialek2005,
abstract = {Many crucial biological processes operate with surprisingly small numbers of molecules, and there is renewed interest in analyzing the impact of noise associated with these small numbers. Twenty-five years ago, Berg and Purcell showed that bacterial chemotaxis, where a single-celled organism must respond to small changes in concentration of chemicals outside the cell, is limited directly by molecule counting noise and that aspects of the bacteria's behavioral and computational strategies must be chosen to minimize the effects of this noise. Here, we revisit and generalize their arguments to estimate the physical limits to signaling processes within the cell and argue that recent experiments are consistent with performance approaching these limits.},

Studying bacterial transcription initiation in Escherichia coli has served as a model for understanding transcriptional control throughout all kingdoms of life. Every step in the pathway between gene and function is exploited to exercise this control, but for reasons of economy, it is plain that the key step to regulate is the initiation of RNA-transcript formation.},

@article{Buchler2003,
abstract = {Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},
