abstract = {Although phenomenlogical models that account for cooperativity in allosteric systems date back to the early and mid-60's (e.g., the KNF and MWC models), there is resurgent interest in the topic due to the recent experimental and computational studies that attempted to reveal, at an atomistic level, how allostery actually works. In this review, using systems for which atomistic simulations have been carried out in our groups as examples, we describe the current understanding of allostery, how the mechanisms go beyond the classical MWC/Pauling-KNF descriptions, and point out that the "new view" of allostery, emphasizing "population shifts," is, in fact, an "old view." The presentation offers not only an up-to-date description of allostery from a theoretical/computational perspective, but also helps to resolve several outstanding issues concerning allostery.},

abstract = {Cells must sense extracellular signals and transfer the information contained about their environment reliably to make appropriate decisions. To perform these tasks, cells use signal transduction networks that are subject to various sources of noise. Here, we study the effects on information transfer of two particular types of noise: basal (leaky) network activity and cell-to-cell variability in the componentry of the network. Basal activity is the propensity for activation of the network output in the absence of the signal of interest. We show, using theoretical models of protein kinase signaling, that the combined effect of the two types of noise makes information transfer by such networks highly vulnerable to the loss of negative feedback. In an experimental study of ERK signaling by single cells with heterogeneous ERK expression levels, we verify our theoretical prediction: In the presence of basal network activity, negative feedback substantially increases information transfer to the nucleus by both preventing a near-flat average response curve and reducing sensitivity to variation in substrate expression levels. The interplay between basal network activity, heterogeneity in network componentry, and feedback is thus critical for the effectiveness of protein kinase signaling. Basal activity is widespread in signaling systems under physiological conditions, has phenotypic consequences, and is often raised in disease. Our results reveal an important role for negative feedback mechanisms in protecting the information transfer function of saturable, heterogeneous cell signaling systems from basal activity.},
annote = {Interesting paper that studies the effect of negative feedback in information transfer.

The paper basically first develops a theoretical model where a kinase signaling pathway includes basal activity (leakiness) and noise in expression levels. They note that when they include some sort of negative feedback the information transfer gets much better.

So then they go and test this with a complicated PK signaling pathway in HeLa cells and show that indeed if they knock out the feedback loop (using siRNA) the information transfer as measured with quantitative fluorescence decreases abruptly.

This could be interesting for me to test with the lac system by including either feedback to repress or activate the production of the repressor, or something along those lines. Let's think about it.},

Many such models are `sloppy', i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher Information Matrix, which we interpret as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. We show how the manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

abstract = {Half a century has passed since the discovery of operons (groups of genes that are transcribed together as a single mRNA). Despite the importance of operons in bacterial gene networks, the relationship between their organization and gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we show using synthetic operons in Escherichia coli that the expression of a given gene increases with the length of the operon and as its position moves farther from the end of the operon. These findings can be explained by a common mechanism; increasing the distance from the start of a gene to the end of the operon (termed the "transcription distance") provides more time for translation to occur during transcription, resulting in increased expression. We confirmed experimentally that the increased expression is indeed due to increased translation. Furthermore our analysis indicates the translation initiation rate for an mRNA is sixfold greater during transcription than after its release, which amplifies the impact of the transcription distance on gene expression. As a result of these mechanisms, gene expression increases by ∼40{\%} for each 1,000 nucleotides of transcription distance. In summary, we demonstrate that a fundamental relationship exists between gene expression and the number, length, and order of the genes in an operon. This relationship has important implications for understanding the functional basis of genome organization and practical applications for synthetic biology.},

A Very relevant paper for my project this is the second time I read this paper. In this work Elf, Gene-Wei Li and Sunney Xie perform some interesting microscopy on the lac repressor. They create a fusion that can dimerize (but not form tetramers) with the YFP-venus protein and lower the expression level of WT to ≈ 3 repressors/cell by putting an O1 binding site at the natural O3 operator position (claiming there is auto regulation). Then they image the repressor at different time intervals and when they see puncta after a 1 s exposure time they claim that it is bound to an operator, when they see no punch they claim that it is not bound (having done allegedly the controls to show that it is not photobleaching). They can add IPTG and see that the puncta disappears, they can also add an IPTG competitor and see how IPTG re-binds the operator.
From these type of measurements along with other clever imaging techniques they can infer a diffusion constant for the 3D search, and using some in-vitro experiments they can determine the diffusion constant for the 1D sliding.
Interesting and cool paper, but I must say that Rob told me he has become slightly skeptical of these results over the years. He wouldn't say why but I must keep that in mind.},

@article{Peterson2015,
abstract = {SignificanceGene expression noise affects a cells biological state and contributes to such phenomena as phenotype switching and cell fate determination. By examining chromosome replication--which is tightly controlled and thus exhibits little noise--we show that variability in mRNA levels across a population is less than previously expected. This noise is due to the transient relaxation of the mRNA from a low- to a high-copy steady state after a gene replication event. Gene location, mRNA degradation rate, and cell doubling time all contribute to observed noise. Our results demonstrate that it is essential to account for gene replication when modelling gene expression or when interpreting experimental results. There are several sources of fluctuations in gene expression. Here we study the effects of time-dependent DNA replication, itself a tightly controlled process, on noise in mRNA levels. Stochastic simulations of constitutive and regulated gene expression are used to analyze the time-averaged mean and variation in each case. The simulations demonstrate that to capture mRNA distributions correctly, chromosome replication must be realistically modeled. Slow relaxation of mRNA from the low copy number steady state before gene replication to the high steady state after replication is set by the transcripts half-life and contributes significantly to the shape of the mRNA distribution. Consequently both the intrinsic kinetics and the gene location play an important role in accounting for the mRNA average and variance. Exact analytic expressions for moments of the mRNA distributions that depend on the DNA copy number, gene location, cell doubling time, and the rates of transcription and degradation are derived for the case of constitutive expression and subsequently extended to provide approximate corrections for regulated expression and RNA polymerase variability. Comparisons of the simulated models and analytical expressions to experimentally measured mRNA distributions show that they better capture the physics of the system than previous theories.},
annote = {This paper sent by Brewster is one of the two papers that followed up his Science paper. In this paper they explore via simulations and analytical work the effect of multiple gene copies during the cell cycle. They claim that the transients are important and once there are two copies of the gene as expected the mRNA copy number relaxes to twice the original amount with a time-scale determined by the mRNA degradation rate.
The paper has some interesting analytical work in which they give some of the rates a random-variable nature rather than a deterministic parameter to include RNAP and transcription factor copy number variability. It would be very interesting to go through these calculations for the Pyramid paper, but for now there are too many details I would like to ignore in my analysis.

This is the second time I read this paper, this time with different eyes. Now that I am exploring the effect of having multiple gene copies on my own project this study suddenly becomes extremely relevant.
The claim of the paper is pretty simple: noise coming from gene replication is important.
What this means is that depending on the position of the gene along the genome and the growth rate a promoter can have multiple copies. This turns out to affect the overall noise. As shown in Fig. 1 the gene duplicates and then the mRNA has to relax to its new equilibrium value. This relaxation depends on the mRNA degradation rate and it might or might not be accurate to assume the mRNA count reaches steady state. 
For this paper they assume a one-state promoter and claim that they can "fit" to Daniel and Brewster's data just by accounting for this noise source given by the multi-copy case. They work out some analytical expression for the mean and fano-factor and perform some Gillespie simulations to show the improvement that their time-dependent theory gives.
What worries me about this study is the fact that there seem to be endless details to get the "correct theory." It is a little bit overwhelming to think of all the possible unaccountable things for the theory to be right. So when trying to do biophysics and trying to obtain what we claim are meaningful parameters, for these kinetic models it is hard to tells whether or not we are right. Maybe is just a weak point on my faith on the process, but I find right now that what I'm trying to do overly ambitious and maybe meaningless.},

annote = {An incredibly inspiring perspective from L{\"{a}}ssig and my new crush Alecksandra Walczak. In this paper they discuss about the emerging field of predictive evolution. Specifically they focus on the scenario where selection is strong enough that from the complex trait space there is one single most likely outcome, allowing for prediction.
They discuss how different mutations give rise to same functional outcomes and give examples of this. This simplifying fact tells us that we do not need to predict the exact mutation landscape to still have predictive power over phenotypic outcomes. They then discuss the role of negative (stabilizing) and positive (directional) selection in creating a single evolutionary outcome. They show a simple intuitive example of a "fitness seascape" where there is an adaptive trait that is changing its optimal value over time (for example affinity of a antigen to an antibody) and a conserve trait that has to be kept constant (for example protein stability). Given these two complementary traits one can predict the outcome of two competing clades.
Overall the paper is an amazing read that I should read multiple times to digest all the beautiful content on it.

Reading again this fantastic review as I run a project at MBL is a great source of inspiration. In this perspective L{\"{a}}ssig and Alecks present an intriguing idea of predicting evolutionary outcomes on short time scales. This idea, close to my heart and to my scientific goal in the near future poses fascinating theoretical and experimental challenges. In rapidly evolving systems such as microbial and viral populations the idea of clonal interference seems to dominate the dynamics of the population. But despite the 'microscopic' irreproducibility of evolution (i.e. the fact that the sequence space is so large) there are some 'macroscopic' properties that if correctly mapped can allow for formal predictions of evolutionary dynamics (i.e. the fact that many mutations map to equivalent phenotypes).
There are a lot of interesting ideas and tons of must-read references in this paper. It will keep bringing inspiration for years to come.},

abstract = {Probability reigns in biology, with random molecular events dictating the fate of individual organisms, and propelling populations of species through evolution. In principle, the master probability equation provides the most complete model of probabilistic behavior in biomolecular networks. In practice, master equations describing complex reaction networks have remained unsolved for over 70 years. This practical challenge is a reason why master equations, for all their potential, have not inspired biological discovery. Herein, we present a closure scheme that solves the master probability equation of networks of chemical or biochemical reactions. We cast the master equation in terms of ordinary differential equations that describe the time evolution of probability distribution moments. We postulate that a finite number of moments capture all of the necessary information, and compute the probability distribution and higher-order moments by maximizing the information entropy of the system. An accurate order closure is selected, and the dynamic evolution of molecular populations is simulated. Comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which merely sample the probability distribution, demonstrates this closure scheme is accurate for several small reaction networks. The importance of this result notwithstanding, a most striking finding is that the steady state of stochastic reaction networks can now be readily computed in a single-step calculation, without the need to simulate the evolution of the probability distribution in time.},

Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature.

abstract = {Moment approximation methods are gaining increasing attention for their use in the approximation of the stochastic kinetics of chemical reaction systems. In this paper we derive a general moment expansion method for any type of propensities and which allows expansion up to any number of moments. For some chemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the dynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation is unable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have a strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give information about higher order moments of the underlying probability distribution. We demonstrate the method using a dimerisation reaction, Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a model of an oscillating p53 system. We show that for the dimerisation reaction and Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics system higher order moments have limited influence on the estimation of the mean, while for the p53 system, the solution for the mean can require several moments to converge to the average obtained from many stochastic simulations. We also find that agreement between lower order moments does not guarantee that higher moments will agree. Compared to stochastic simulations, our approach is numerically highly efficient at capturing the behaviour of stochastic systems in terms of the average and higher moments, and we provide expressions for the computational cost for different system sizes and orders of approximation. We show how the moment expansion method can be employed to efficiently quantify parameter sensitivity. Finally we investigate the effects of using too few moments on parameter estimation, and provide guidance on how to estimate if the distribution can be accurately approximated using only a few moments.},

As the corresponding number of discrete states is, for most processes, large, a direct numerical simulation of the CME is in general infeasible. In this paper we introduce the method of conditional moments (MCM), a novel approximation method for the solution of the CME. The MCM employs a discrete stochastic description for low-copy number species and a moment-based description for medium/high-copy number species. The moments of the medium/high-copy number species are conditioned on the state of the low abundance species, which allows us to capture complex correlation structures arising, e.g., for multi-attractor and oscillatory systems. We prove that the MCM provides a generalization of previous approximations of the CME based on hybrid modeling and moment-based methods. Furthermore, it improves upon these existing methods, as we illustrate using a model for the dynamics of stochastic single-gene expression. This application example shows that due to the more general structure, the MCM allows for the approximation of multi-modal distributions.},

abstract = {Gene expression levels carry information about signals that have functional significance for the organism. Using the gap gene network in the fruit fly embryo as an example, we show how this information can be decoded, building a dictionary that translates expression levels into a map of implied positions. The optimal decoder makes use of graded variations in absolute expression level, resulting in positional estimates that are precise to {\~{}}1{\%} of the embryo's length. We test this optimal decoder by analyzing gap gene expression in embryos lacking some of the primary maternal inputs to the network. The resulting maps are distorted, and these distortions predict, with no free parameters, the positions of expression stripes for the pair-rule genes in the mutant embryos.},
annote = {Interesting paper by Tkacik, Bialek and Gregor where they analyze the decoding of the gap genes in the Drosophila developing embryo.
In this paper rather than modeling molecular interactions with the enhancers they make a simple (but strong) assumption: they assume that there is an optimal decoder for the position of the cell along the embryo as a function of the gap genes expression level. In this way they can create a "dictionary" based on Bayes theorem of
P(x|{\{}g{\}}) = P({\{}g{\}}|x)P(x) / P({\{}g{\}}).
Then given this "if the cell responds to the expression level in a way that matches the structure of this distirbution, then that response is part of an optimal decoding".
I am not a 100{\%} sure why is that the case, but they use this simple assumption to predict the position of the stripes generated by the pair-rule genes, getting a very good agreement between this parameter free prediction and the actual measurements on embryos.},

Transmitting information through complex signaling networks with redundancies can overcome this limitation. We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise. Bottlenecks likewise constrain information attained by networks signaling through multiple genes or cells.},

abstract = {Cell signaling can be thought of fundamentally as an information transmission problem in which chemical messengers relay information about the external environment to the decision centers within a cell. Due to the biochemical nature of cellular signal transduction networks, molecular noise will inevitably limit the fidelity of any messages received and processed by a cell's signal transduction networks, leaving it with an imperfect impression of its environment. Fortunately, Shannon's information theory provides a mathematical framework independent of network complexity that can quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted despite biochemical noise. In particular, the channel capacity can be used to measure the maximum number of stimuli a cell can distinguish based upon the noisy responses of its signaling systems. Here, we provide a primer for quantitative biologists that covers fundamental concepts of information theory, highlights several key considerations when experimentally measuring channel capacity, and describes successful examples of the application of information theoretic analysis to biological signaling.},

abstract = {We investigate cellular response to extracellular signals by using information theory techniques motivated by recent experiments. We present results for the steady state of the following gene regulatory models found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells: a linear transcription-translation model and a positive or negative auto-regulatory model. We calculate both the information capacity and the mutual information exactly for simple models and approximately for the full model. We find that (1) small changes in mutual information can lead to potentially important changes in cellular response and (2) there are diminishing returns in the fidelity of response as the mutual information increases. We calculate the information capacity using Gillespie simulations of a model for the TNF-$\alpha$-NF-$\kappa$ B network and find good agreement with the measured value for an experimental realization of this network. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the differences in cellular response when comparing experimentally measured mutual information values of different gene regulatory models. Our calculations demonstrate that Gillespie simulations can be used to compute the mutual information of more complex gene regulatory models, providing a potentially useful tool in synthetic biology.},
annote = {I hate this paper!

They stole my priviledge of being the first one to compute the channel capacity of a genetic circuit using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm...

But anyways, with respect to their science I think is not a super interesting paper. For me their big insight is that under the metric they use to determine if a cell expressed the right amount of a gene or not having less than 1 bit of information is actually useful.

In other words they study the response of cells to different environments (assuming a linear response between signal and gene expression, which I completely disagree) assuming that the cells can only have a binary response. Under this scenario part of the population is exposed to a low signal and it should therefore express a low amount, and the rest of the population is exposed to a high signal, having to express at high levels. Given that gene expression is noisy you'll find cells in the opposite phenotype as they should so the cells would have less than 1 bit of information because they can't even properly distinguish between high and low.

But what these guys find is that even if you have 0.35 bits of information that is "better than nothing" and actually getting the full bit turns out to be very hard having diminishing returns in how much better you do given that you increase your information processing capacity. This last point is analogous to what Bialek showed in his RD curves where you start getting more and more information, but the benefit in fitness is not as by anymore.

Overall I hate this paper because they stoled my glory :-(},

abstract = {Changes in a cell's external or internal conditions are usually reflected in the concentrations of the relevant transcription factors. These proteins in turn modulate the expression levels of the genes under their control and sometimes need to perform nontrivial computations that integrate several inputs and affect multiple genes. At the same time, the activities of the regulated genes would fluctuate even if the inputs were held fixed, as a consequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must fundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use information theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in simple genetic regulatory elements in the presence of physically realistic noise sources. The dependence of this "channel capacity" on noise parameters, cooperativity and cost of making signaling molecules is explored systematically. We find that, in the range of parameters probed by recent in vivo measurements, capacities higher than one bit should be achievable. It is of course generally accepted that gene regulatory elements must, in order to function properly, have a capacity of at least one bit. The central point of our analysis is the demonstration that simple physical models of noisy gene transcription, with realistic parameters, can indeed achieve this capacity: it was not self-evident that this should be so. We also demonstrate that capacities significantly greater than one bit are possible, so that transcriptional regulation need not be limited to simple "on-off" components. The question whether real systems actually exploit this richer possibility is beyond the scope of this investigation.},

This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

As experiments are becoming increasingly precise and the deviations from the two-state model start to be observable, we ask about the experimental signatures of complex multistate promoters, as well as the functional consequences of this additional complexity. In detail, we i), extend the calculations for noise in gene expression to promoters described by state transition diagrams with multiple states, ii), systematically compute the experimentally accessible noise characteristics for these complex promoters, and iii), use information theory to evaluate the channel capacities of complex promoter architectures and compare them with the baseline provided by the two-state model. We find that adding internal states to the promoter generically decreases channel capacity, except in certain cases, three of which (cooperativity, dual-role regulation, promoter cycling) we analyze in detail. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},
annote = {Incredibly important and relevant paper for my PhD project. Tkacik does a fantastic job of exploring how certain parameters change the information transmission of different promoter architectures. He focuses mainly in the two state promoter (the one that I am using for simple repression) and explores alternative more complex architectures, such as cooperative regulation and multiple state promoters to see if other architectures can transmit more information.

The authors model the noise using a langevin force which basically assumes the functional form of the noise is known. This is a very interesting approach since it simplifies enormously the math and allows the use of analytical tools such as the small noise approximation among other things. This could be a super interesting approach for my project if the parameter regime I use (the one that I believe is true given experimental evidence) allows it.

Overal I think that the paper could have explore other things such as how much information is lost at each step of the central dogma, and I think that the way I capture the induction using the MWC model is a more accurate version of this, but we defninitely share lots of ideas to the point that I think this paper scooped my idea of publishing a theory paper on my stuff.},

For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

Here we summarize recent developments in the application of information theory to gene regulatory networks. We first review basic concepts in information theory necessary for understanding recent work. We then discuss the functional complexity of gene regulation, which arises from the molecular nature of the regulatory interactions. We end by reviewing some experiments that support the view that genetic networks responsible for early development of multicellular organisms might be maximizing transmitted 'positional information'.},

One thing to highlight is their explanation of the two main differences between information theory in biology vs. engineering: 
1) The first difference is that in Shannon's work, MI is used to describe information transfer by typically many uses of a channel, while in biology the focus has mostly been on a ‘single use', considering systems at steady-state
2) In engineering, the distribution of the input can be chosen by the user of the channel to maximize the MI, in order to maximize the number of distinguishable messages, but, in systems biology, the distribution of the signal is typically experienced and not chosen by the cell (with exceptions such as morphogens).
The authors claim that one niche where research is needed is to connect information to fitness experimentally to test the optimality theories
In general I really liked the paper!},

We show, through??a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are ???10{\%}.

By considering a two-state environment, either poor or rich in nutrients, we show that promoter occupancy is proportional to the (posterior) probability of the high nutrient state given current intracellular information. We demonstrate that single-gene networks inferring and responding to a high environmental state infer best when negatively controlled, and those inferring and responding to a low environmental state infer best when positively controlled. Our interpretation is supported by experimental data from the lac operon and should provide a basis for both understanding more complex cellular decision-making and designing synthetic inference circuits.},

abstract = {We quantify the influence of the topology of a transcriptional regulatory network on its ability to process environmental signals. By posing the problem in terms of information theory, we do this without specifying the function performed by the network. Specifically, we study the maximum mutual information between the input (chemical) signal and the output (genetic) response attainable by the network in the context of an analytic model of particle number fluctuations. We perform this analysis for all biochemical circuits, including various feedback loops, that can be built out of 3 chemical species, each under the control of one regulator. We find that a generic network, constrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can transduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to achieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These high-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the networks' biochemical parameters; moreover they are easier to achieve in networks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall negative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we derive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support multiple high-information solutions. These findings suggest a potential resolution of the "cross-talk" phenomenon as well as the previously unexplained observation that transcription factors that undergo proteolysis are more likely to be auto-repressive.},

Here we show that these two measures are intimately related in the context of biological evolution. We present a sim-ple model of evolution in an uncertain environment, and calculate the increase in Darwinian fitness that is made possible by information about the environmen-tal state. This fitness increase — the fitness value of information — is a composite of both the Shannon entropy and the decision-theoretic measure of infor-mation value. Furthermore, the Shannon entropy of the environment, which seemingly fails to take any-thing about Darwinian fitness into account, nonethe-less imposes an upper bound on the fitness value of information.},

abstract = {One of the paramount goals of synthetic biology is to have the ability to tune transcriptional networks to targeted levels of expression at will. As a step in that direction, we have constructed a set of 18 unique binding sites for E. coli RNA Polymerase (RNAP) $\delta$⁷⁰ holoenzyme, designed using a model of sequence-dependent binding energy combined with a thermodynamic model of transcription to produce a targeted level of gene expression. This promoter set allows us to determine the correspondence between the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules or protein products and the predicted promoter binding energies measured in k(B)T energy units. These binding sites adhere on average to the predicted level of gene expression over 3 orders of magnitude in constitutive gene expression, to within a factor of 3 in both protein and mRNA copy number. With these promoters in hand, we then place them under the regulatory control of a bacterial repressor and show that again there is a strict correspondence between the measured and predicted levels of expression, demonstrating the transferability of the promoters to an alternate regulatory context. In particular, our thermodynamic model predicts the expression from our promoters under a range of repressor concentrations between several per cell up to over 100 per cell. After correcting the predicted polymerase binding strength using the data from the unregulated promoter, the thermodynamic model accurately predicts the expression for the simple repression strains to within 30{\%}. Demonstration of modular promoter design, where parts of the circuit (such as RNAP/TF binding strength and transcription factor copy number) can be independently chosen from a stock list and combined to give a predictable result, has important implications as an engineering tool for use in synthetic biology.},

Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits.

Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of {\~{}}1 along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

These results provide parameter-free, quantitative predictions connecting independently measurable quantities. Although we have considered only the simplified problem of a single gene responding to a single TF, we find that these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo and that this system achieves approximately 90{\%} of its theoretical maximum information transmission.},

@article{Klumpp2008,
abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

@article{Bintu2005a,
abstract = {The expression of genes is regularly characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the "regulation factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

@article{Bialek2005,
abstract = {Many crucial biological processes operate with surprisingly small numbers of molecules, and there is renewed interest in analyzing the impact of noise associated with these small numbers. Twenty-five years ago, Berg and Purcell showed that bacterial chemotaxis, where a single-celled organism must respond to small changes in concentration of chemicals outside the cell, is limited directly by molecule counting noise and that aspects of the bacteria's behavioral and computational strategies must be chosen to minimize the effects of this noise. Here, we revisit and generalize their arguments to estimate the physical limits to signaling processes within the cell and argue that recent experiments are consistent with performance approaching these limits.},

@article{Buchler2003,
abstract = {Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},
