abstract = {Gene expression levels carry information about signals that have functional significance for the organism. Using the gap gene network in the fruit fly embryo as an example, we show how this information can be decoded, building a dictionary that translates expression levels into a map of implied positions. The optimal decoder makes use of graded variations in absolute expression level, resulting in positional estimates that are precise to {\~{}}1{\%} of the embryo's length. We test this optimal decoder by analyzing gap gene expression in embryos lacking some of the primary maternal inputs to the network. The resulting maps are distorted, and these distortions predict, with no free parameters, the positions of expression stripes for the pair-rule genes in the mutant embryos.},
annote = {Interesting paper by Tkacik, Bialek and Gregor where they analyze the decoding of the gap genes in the Drosophila developing embryo.
In this paper rather than modeling molecular interactions with the enhancers they make a simple (but strong) assumption: they assume that there is an optimal decoder for the position of the cell along the embryo as a function of the gap genes expression level. In this way they can create a "dictionary" based on Bayes theorem of
P(x|{\{}g{\}}) = P({\{}g{\}}|x)P(x) / P({\{}g{\}}).
Then given this "if the cell responds to the expression level in a way that matches the structure of this distirbution, then that response is part of an optimal decoding".
I am not a 100{\%} sure why is that the case, but they use this simple assumption to predict the position of the stripes generated by the pair-rule genes, getting a very good agreement between this parameter free prediction and the actual measurements on embryos.},

abstract = {Cells must sense extracellular signals and transfer the information contained about their environment reliably to make appropriate decisions. To perform these tasks, cells use signal transduction networks that are subject to various sources of noise. Here, we study the effects on information transfer of two particular types of noise: basal (leaky) network activity and cell-to-cell variability in the componentry of the network. Basal activity is the propensity for activation of the network output in the absence of the signal of interest. We show, using theoretical models of protein kinase signaling, that the combined effect of the two types of noise makes information transfer by such networks highly vulnerable to the loss of negative feedback. In an experimental study of ERK signaling by single cells with heterogeneous ERK expression levels, we verify our theoretical prediction: In the presence of basal network activity, negative feedback substantially increases information transfer to the nucleus by both preventing a near-flat average response curve and reducing sensitivity to variation in substrate expression levels. The interplay between basal network activity, heterogeneity in network componentry, and feedback is thus critical for the effectiveness of protein kinase signaling. Basal activity is widespread in signaling systems under physiological conditions, has phenotypic consequences, and is often raised in disease. Our results reveal an important role for negative feedback mechanisms in protecting the information transfer function of saturable, heterogeneous cell signaling systems from basal activity.},
annote = {Interesting paper that studies the effect of negative feedback in information transfer.

The paper basically first develops a theoretical model where a kinase signaling pathway includes basal activity (leakiness) and noise in expression levels. They note that when they include some sort of negative feedback the information transfer gets much better.

So then they go and test this with a complicated PK signaling pathway in HeLa cells and show that indeed if they knock out the feedback loop (using siRNA) the information transfer as measured with quantitative fluorescence decreases abruptly.

This could be interesting for me to test with the lac system by including either feedback to repress or activate the production of the repressor, or something along those lines. Let's think about it.},

abstract = {We investigate cellular response to extracellular signals by using information theory techniques motivated by recent experiments. We present results for the steady state of the following gene regulatory models found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells: a linear transcription-translation model and a positive or negative auto-regulatory model. We calculate both the information capacity and the mutual information exactly for simple models and approximately for the full model. We find that (1) small changes in mutual information can lead to potentially important changes in cellular response and (2) there are diminishing returns in the fidelity of response as the mutual information increases. We calculate the information capacity using Gillespie simulations of a model for the TNF-$\alpha$-NF-$\kappa$ B network and find good agreement with the measured value for an experimental realization of this network. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the differences in cellular response when comparing experimentally measured mutual information values of different gene regulatory models. Our calculations demonstrate that Gillespie simulations can be used to compute the mutual information of more complex gene regulatory models, providing a potentially useful tool in synthetic biology.},
annote = {I hate this paper!

They stole my priviledge of being the first one to compute the channel capacity of a genetic circuit using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm...

But anyways, with respect to their science I think is not a super interesting paper. For me their big insight is that under the metric they use to determine if a cell expressed the right amount of a gene or not having less than 1 bit of information is actually useful.

In other words they study the response of cells to different environments (assuming a linear response between signal and gene expression, which I completely disagree) assuming that the cells can only have a binary response. Under this scenario part of the population is exposed to a low signal and it should therefore express a low amount, and the rest of the population is exposed to a high signal, having to express at high levels. Given that gene expression is noisy you'll find cells in the opposite phenotype as they should so the cells would have less than 1 bit of information because they can't even properly distinguish between high and low.

But what these guys find is that even if you have 0.35 bits of information that is "better than nothing" and actually getting the full bit turns out to be very hard having diminishing returns in how much better you do given that you increase your information processing capacity. This last point is analogous to what Bialek showed in his RD curves where you start getting more and more information, but the benefit in fitness is not as by anymore.

Overall I hate this paper because they stoled my glory :-(},

abstract = {Changes in a cell's external or internal conditions are usually reflected in the concentrations of the relevant transcription factors. These proteins in turn modulate the expression levels of the genes under their control and sometimes need to perform nontrivial computations that integrate several inputs and affect multiple genes. At the same time, the activities of the regulated genes would fluctuate even if the inputs were held fixed, as a consequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must fundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use information theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in simple genetic regulatory elements in the presence of physically realistic noise sources. The dependence of this "channel capacity" on noise parameters, cooperativity and cost of making signaling molecules is explored systematically. We find that, in the range of parameters probed by recent in vivo measurements, capacities higher than one bit should be achievable. It is of course generally accepted that gene regulatory elements must, in order to function properly, have a capacity of at least one bit. The central point of our analysis is the demonstration that simple physical models of noisy gene transcription, with realistic parameters, can indeed achieve this capacity: it was not self-evident that this should be so. We also demonstrate that capacities significantly greater than one bit are possible, so that transcriptional regulation need not be limited to simple "on-off" components. The question whether real systems actually exploit this richer possibility is beyond the scope of this investigation.},

This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

As experiments are becoming increasingly precise and the deviations from the two-state model start to be observable, we ask about the experimental signatures of complex multistate promoters, as well as the functional consequences of this additional complexity. In detail, we i), extend the calculations for noise in gene expression to promoters described by state transition diagrams with multiple states, ii), systematically compute the experimentally accessible noise characteristics for these complex promoters, and iii), use information theory to evaluate the channel capacities of complex promoter architectures and compare them with the baseline provided by the two-state model. We find that adding internal states to the promoter generically decreases channel capacity, except in certain cases, three of which (cooperativity, dual-role regulation, promoter cycling) we analyze in detail. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},
annote = {Incredibly important and relevant paper for my PhD project. Tkacik does a fantastic job of exploring how certain parameters change the information transmission of different promoter architectures. He focuses mainly in the two state promoter (the one that I am using for simple repression) and explores alternative more complex architectures, such as cooperative regulation and multiple state promoters to see if other architectures can transmit more information.

The authors model the noise using a langevin force which basically assumes the functional form of the noise is known. This is a very interesting approach since it simplifies enormously the math and allows the use of analytical tools such as the small noise approximation among other things. This could be a super interesting approach for my project if the parameter regime I use (the one that I believe is true given experimental evidence) allows it.

Overal I think that the paper could have explore other things such as how much information is lost at each step of the central dogma, and I think that the way I capture the induction using the MWC model is a more accurate version of this, but we defninitely share lots of ideas to the point that I think this paper scooped my idea of publishing a theory paper on my stuff.},

We perform this analysis for all biochemical circuits, including various feedback loops, that can be built out of 3 chemical species, each under the control of one regulator. We find that a generic network, constrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can transduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to achieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These high-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the networks' biochemical parameters; moreover they are easier to achieve in networks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall negative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we derive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support multiple high-information solutions.

Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of {\~{}}1 along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo.

@article{Eldar2010,
abstract = {The genetic circuits that regulate cellular functions are subject to stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in the levels of their components. Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables. We further indicate some of the important challenges and opportunities going forward.},

@article{Tkacik2008,
abstract = {In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor (TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise in gene expression satisfy certain matching relations, which we derive. These results provide parameter-free, quantitative predictions connecting independently measurable quantities. Although we have considered only the simplified problem of a single gene responding to a single TF, we find that these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo and that this system achieves approximately 90{\%} of its theoretical maximum information transmission.},

@article{Bialek2005,
abstract = {Many crucial biological processes operate with surprisingly small numbers of molecules, and there is renewed interest in analyzing the impact of noise associated with these small numbers. Twenty-five years ago, Berg and Purcell showed that bacterial chemotaxis, where a single-celled organism must respond to small changes in concentration of chemicals outside the cell, is limited directly by molecule counting noise and that aspects of the bacteria's behavioral and computational strategies must be chosen to minimize the effects of this noise. Here, we revisit and generalize their arguments to estimate the physical limits to signaling processes within the cell and argue that recent experiments are consistent with performance approaching these limits.},
