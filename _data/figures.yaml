    Mean (solid line) $\pm$ standard deviation (shaded region) for the mRNA
    (upper panel) and protein (lower panel) dynamics. Cells spend a fraction of
    the cell cycle with a single copy of the promoter (light brown) and the
    rest of the cell cycle with two copies (light yellow). Black arrows
    indicate time of cell division.

  desc: >
      Zero parameter-fit predictions (lines) and experimental data (circles) of
      the gene expression fold-change (upper row) and noise (lower row) for
      repressor binding sites with different affinities (different columns) and
      different repressor copy numbers per cell (different lines on each
      panel). Error bars in data represent the 95% confidence interval on the
      quantities as computed from bootstrap estiamates generated from the
      single-cell fluorescence measurements. In the theory curves dotted lines
      indicate plot in linear scale to include zero while solid lines indicate
      logarithmic scale. White dots on the lower row are plotted on a different
      scale for visual clarity.

      Channel capacity as inferred using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm [41] for
      varying number of repressors and repressor-DNA affinities. All inferences
      were performed using 12 IPTG concentrations as detailed in the Methods.
      Lines represent zero-parameter fit predictions done with the maximum
      entropy distributions as those shown in Fig. 4. Points represent
      inferences made from single cell fluorescence distributions (See Appendix
      S7 for further details). Solid lines indicate plot in logarithmic scale,
      while dashed line indicates linear scale ton include zero.

      Lower panel illustrates that zero channel capacity indicates that all
      distributions overlap. Upper panel illustrates that as the channel
      capacity increases, the separation between distributions increases as
      well.
