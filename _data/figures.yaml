  desc:  mean (solid line) Â± standard deviation (shaded region) for the mRNA
  (upper panel) and protein (lower panel) dynamics. Cells spend a fraction of
  the cell cycle with a single copy of the promoter (light brown) and the rest
  of the cell cycle with two copies (light yellow). Black arrows indicate time
  of cell division.

  expression"

  desc: >
      Zero parameter-fit predictions (lines) and experimental data (circles) of
      the gene expression fold-change (upper row) and noise (lower row) for
      repressor binding sites with different affinities (different columns) and
      different repressor copy numbers per cell (different lines on each
      panel). Error bars in data represent the 95% confidence interval on the
      quantities as computed from bootstrap estiamates generated from the
      single-cell fluorescence measurements. In the theory curves dotted lines
      indicate plot in linear scale to include zero while solid lines indicate
      logarithmic scale. White dots on the lower row are plotted on a different
      scale for visual clarity.
