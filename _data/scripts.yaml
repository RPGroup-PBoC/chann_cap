  distribution for a fine grid of IPTG values with the experimentally explored
  repressor copy numbers only.

  This script computes in parallel the average moments of the mRNA and protein
  distribution for a fine grid of repressor copy number values with the 12
  experimental IPTG concentrations.

  This script computes in parallel the average moments of the mRNA and protein
  distribution for a grid of repressor up to 10^6 copy number values with the
  12 experimental IPTG concentrations.

  name: mdcd_ogorman_param.py
  desc: >
    This script computes in parallel the average moments of the mRNA and
    protein distribution for the experimentally measured combinations of
    operators and repressors, but this time using the global parameter
    inferences as reported in [Chure et. al,
    2019](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/mwc_mutants/index.html) that
    phenomenologically capture better the induction profile for the O3 operator
    and the general steepness of the other strains.

  Script that takes the protein distribution moments as inferred from the
  numerical integration of the dynamical equations and computes the
  corresponding Lagrange multipliers for a maximum entropy approximation of the
  distribution.

  Script that takes the protein distribution moments as inferred from the
  numerical integration of the dynamical equations and computes the

- script:
  name: maxent_protein_dist_correction.py
  desc: >
    Script that updates the second and third moment of the protein distribution
    to match the factor of two in the deviation between the original
    theoretical prediction and the experimental data. It then uses these
    updated moments along with the first protein moment to infer the maximum
    entropy distribution.
