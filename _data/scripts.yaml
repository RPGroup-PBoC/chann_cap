  name: mdcd_ogorman_param.py
  desc: >
    This script computes in parallel the average moments of the mRNA and
    protein distribution for the experimentally measured combinations of
    operators and repressors, but this time using the global parameter
    inferences as reported in [Chure et. al,
    2019](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/mwc_mutants/index.html) that
    phenomenologically capture better the induction profile for the O3 operator
    and the general steepness of the other strains.

  desc: >
    Script that updates the second and third moment of the protein distribution
    to match the factor of two in the deviation between the original
    theoretical prediction and the experimental data. It then uses these
    updated moments along with the first protein moment to infer the maximum
    entropy distribution.
