## Abstract
Given the stochastic nature of gene expression, genetically identical cells
exposed to the same environmental inputs will produce different outputs. This
heterogeneity has consequences for how cells are able to survive in changing
environments. Recent work has explored the use of information theory as a
framework to understand the accuracy with which cells can ascertain the state of
their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these approaches is limited and
has not been rigorously tested using precision measurements. To that end, we
generate a minimal model for a simple genetic circuit in which all parameter
values for the model come from independently published data sets. We then
predict the information processing capacity of the genetic circuit for a suite
of biophysical parameters such as protein copy number and protein-DNA affinity.
We compare these parameter- free predictions with an experimental determination
of the information processing capacity of *E. coli* cells, and find that our
minimal model accurately captures the experimental data.
